ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In the past year at Carnegie Mellon steady progress has been made in the area of acoustic and language modeling. The result has been a dramatic reduction in speech recognition errors in the SPHINX-II system. In this paper, we review SPHINX-I/and summarize our recent efforts on improved speech recognition. Recently SPHINX-I/ achieved the lowest error rate in the November 1992 DARPA evaluations. For 5000-word, speaker-independent, continuous, speech recognition, the error rate was reduced to 5%.</Paragraph>
