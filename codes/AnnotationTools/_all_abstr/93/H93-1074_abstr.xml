ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes some recent experiments that assess user behavior in a multi-modal environment in which actions can be performed with equivalent effect in speech, keyboard or scroller modes. Results indicate that users freely choose speech over other modalities, even when it is less efficient in objective terms, such as time-to-completion or input error.</Paragraph>
