Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We show how techniques known from generMized LR parsing can be applied to left-corner parsing. The ~esulting parsing algorithm for context-free grammars has some advantages over generalized LR parsing: the sizes and generation times of the parsers are smaller, the produced output is more compact, and the basic parsing technique can more easily be adapted to arbitrary context-free grammars.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The algorithm can be seen as an optimization of algorithms known from existing literature. A strong advantage of our presentation is that it makes explicit the role of left-corner parsing in these algorithms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Keywords: Generalized LR parsing, left-corner parsing, chart parsing, hidden left recursion.</Paragraph>
