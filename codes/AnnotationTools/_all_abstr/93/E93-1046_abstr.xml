Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We are concerned with dependency-oriented morphosyntactic parsing of running text. While a parsing grammar should avoid introducing structurally unresolvable distinctions in order to optimise on the accuracy of the parser, it also is beneficial for the grammarian to have as expressive a structural representation available as possible. In a reductionistic parsing system this policy may result in considerable ambiguity in the input; however, even massive ambiguity can be tackled efficiently with an accurate parsing description and effective parsing technology.</Paragraph>
