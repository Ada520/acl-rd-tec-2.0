ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Our work focuses on identifying various types of lexical data in large corpora through statistical analysis. In this paper, we present a method for grouping adjectives according to their meaning, as a step towards the automatic identification of adjectival scales. We describe how our system exploits two sources of linguistic knowledge in a corpus to compute a measure of similarity between two adjectives, using statistical techniques and a clustering algorithm for grouping. We evaluate the significance of the results produced by our system for a sample set of adjecfives. null</Paragraph>
