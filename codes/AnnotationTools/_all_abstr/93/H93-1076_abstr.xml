ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Two themes have evolved in speech and text image processing work at Xerox PARC that expand and redefine the role of recognition technology in d~ument-oriented appficafions. One is the development of systems that provide functionality similar to that of text processors but operate directly on audio and scanned image data. A second, related theme is the use of speech and text-nnage recognition to re-Irieve arbitrary, user-specified information from documents with signal content. This paper discusses three research initiatives at PARC that exemplify these themes: a text-image editor\[I\], a wordspotter for voice editing and indexing\[12\], and a decoding framework for scanned-document content retrieval\[4\]. 1 The discussion focuses on key concepts embodied in the research that enable novel signal-based document processing functionality.</Paragraph>
