APPROACH
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Traditional approaches to the problem of extracting data from texts have emphasized hand-crafted linguisti c knowledge . In contrast, BBN's PLUM system (Probabilistic Language Understanding Model) was developed as par t of an ARPA-funded research effort on integrating probabilistic language models with more traditional linguisti c techniques. Our research and development goals are : * more rapid development of new applications , * the ability to train (and re-train) systems based on user markings of correct and incorrect output , * more accurate selection among interpretations when more than one is found, an d * more robust partial interpretation when no complete interpretation can be found .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We began this research agenda approximately three years ago . During the past two years, we have evaluated muc h of our effort in porting our data extraction system (PLUM) to a new language (Japanese) and to two new domains .</Paragraph>
