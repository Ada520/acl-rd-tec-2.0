1. APPROACH
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Traditional approaches to the problem of extracting data from texts have emphasized hand-crafted linguistic knowledge. In contrast, BBN's PLUM system (Probabilistic Language Understanding Model) was developed as part of an ARPA-funded research effort on integrating probabilistic language models with more traditional linguistic techniques. Our research and development goals are: * Achieving high performance in objective evaluations, such as the Tipster evaluations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> deg Reducing human effort in porting the natural language algorithms to new domains and to new languages.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> * Providing technology that is scalable to realistic applications.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> We began this research agenda approximately three years ago. During the past two years, we have ported our data extraction system (PLUM) to a new language (Japanese) and to two new domains.</Paragraph>
