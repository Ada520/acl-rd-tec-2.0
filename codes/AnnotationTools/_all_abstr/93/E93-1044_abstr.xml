Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper contributes to the theory of substructural logics .that are of interest to categorial grammarians. Combining semantic ideas of Hepple \[1990\] and Morrill \[1990\], proof-theoretic ideas of Venema \[1993b; 1993a\] and the theory of equational specifications, a class of resource-preserving logics is defined, for which decidability and completeness theorems are established.</Paragraph>
