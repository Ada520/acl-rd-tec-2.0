Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses automatic acquisition of predicate-argument mapping in- formation from multilingual texts. The lexicon of our NLP system abstracts the language-dependent portion of predicate-argument mapping information from the core meaning of verb senses (i.e. semantic concepts as defined in the knowledge base). We represent this mapping information in terms of cross-linguistically generalized mapping types called situation types and word sense-specific idiosyncrasies. This representation has enabled us to automatically acquire predicate-argument map- ping information, specifically situation types and idiosyncrasies, for verbs in English, Spanish, and Japanese texts.</Paragraph>
