Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The dynamic interpretation of a formula as a binary relation (inducing transitions) on states is extended by alternative treatments of implication, universal quantification, negation and disjunction that are more &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; (in a precise sense) than the usual reductions to tests from quantified dynamic logic (which, nonetheless, can be recovered from the new connectives). An analysis of the &amp;quot;donkey&amp;quot; sentence followed by the assertion &amp;quot;It will kick back&amp;quot; is provided. null</Paragraph>
