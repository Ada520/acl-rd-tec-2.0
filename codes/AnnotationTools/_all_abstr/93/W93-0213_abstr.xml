4 Conclusion
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper has presented a new way of justifying a set of relations, by viewing them as modelling psychological constructs and using cue phrases as evidence for these constructs.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A corpus of cue phrases has been gathered and worked into a taxonomy, from which all isomorphic taxonomy of relations can be derived.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The benefits of this methodology are considerable. To begin with, it sets out a systematic way to decide on a set of relations: any disagreement can be traced to a particular stage in the process, such as the decision that a word is a cue phrase, or the decision that two phrases are synonymous. Furthermore, the assumption of psychological reality gives the relations in the taxonomy a clear explanatory role in a theory of discourse coherence: they are not just 'purely descriptive' constructs. Finally, the methodology being proposed is incremental.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> Many important decisions about relation definitions--whether parameters should be used, whether intentions need to be specified separately--can be deferred until after the taxonomy of cue phrases has been constructed: at this point, the taxonomy serves as a useful source of evidence for such decisions.</Paragraph>
