ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper deals with search algorithms for real-time speech recognition. We argue that software-only speech recognition has several critical advantages over using special or parallel hardware. We present a history of several advances in search algorithms, which together, have made it possible to implement real-time recognition of large vocabularies on a single workstation without the need for any hardware accelerators. We discuss the Forward-Backward Search algorithm in detail, as this is the key algorithm that has made possible recognition of very large vocabularies in real-time.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The result is that we can recognize continuous speech with a vocabulary of 20,000 words strictly in real-time entirely in software on a high-end workstation with large memory. We demonstrate that the computation needed grows as the cube root of the vocabulary size.</Paragraph>
