1. Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In the environment of word-processors thesauri serve the user's convenience in choosing the best suitable synonym of a word. Words in text of agglutinative languages occur almost always as inflected forms, thus finding them directly in a stem vocabulary is impossible. H01y0ltu, the inflectional thesaurus coping with this problem is introduced in the paper.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1">  2. Synonym dictionary with  morphological knowledge The inflectional thesaurus is a tool which (1) first performs the morphological segmentation of the input wordform, then (2) finds its stem's lexical base(s), (3) stores the suffix sequence situated on the right of the actual stem-allomorph, (4) offers the synonyms for the lexical base(s), and (5) generates the new word-form consisting of the adequate allomorph of the chosen stem and the adequate allomorph of the above suffix-sequence.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Both the morphological analysis and synthesis steps are done by the Humor ~igh-speed unification morphology) method described by Pr6sz~ky and Tihanyi (1992, 1993). The possible roots and the suffixes following them are temporarily stored, and H01y0ft0 performs the morphological synthesis on the basis of the new (synonym) root and the internal code of the stored suffix sequence.
