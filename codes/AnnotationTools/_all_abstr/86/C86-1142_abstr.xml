Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a method for converting a task-dependent grammar into a word predictor of a speech understanding system, Since tile word prediction is a top-down operation, left recursive rules induces an infinite looping. We have solved this problem by applying an algorithm for bottom-up parsing,</Paragraph>
