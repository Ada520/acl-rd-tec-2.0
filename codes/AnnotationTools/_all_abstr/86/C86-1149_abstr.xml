Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Building on the well-established premise that reliable machine translation requires a significant degree of. text comprehension, this paper presents a recent advance in multi-lingual knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT). Unlike previous approaches, the current method provides for separate syntactic and semantic knowledge sources that are integrated dynamically for parsing and generation. Such a separation enables the system to have syntactic grammars, language specific but domain general, and semantic knowledge bases, domain specific but language general.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Subsequently, grammars and domain knowledge are precompiled automatically in any desired combination to produce very efficient and very thorough real-time parsers. A pilot implementation of our KBMT architecture using functional grammars and entity-oriented semantics demonstrates the feasibility of the new approach?</Paragraph>
