Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The purpose of this contribution is to formulate ways in which the homonymy of so-called 'Modal Particles' and their etymons can be handled. Our aim is to show that not only a strategy for this type of homonymy can be worked out, but also a formalization of information beyond propositional content can be introduced with a view to its MT application. null</Paragraph>
