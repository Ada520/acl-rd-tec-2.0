<Paragraph position="0"> A model of Japanese honorific expressions ill situation semantics is proposed. Situation semantics provides considerable power for analyzing the complicated structure of Japanese honorific expressions. The main feature of this model is a set of basic rules for context switching in honorific sentences. Mizutani~ theory of Japanese honorifics is presented and incorporated in the model which has been used to develope an experimental systom capable of analyzing honorific context. Stone features of this system are described.</Paragraph>
