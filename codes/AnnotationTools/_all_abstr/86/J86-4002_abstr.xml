REFERENCE IDENTIFICATION AND REFERENCE IDENTIFICATION FAILURES
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The goal of this work is the enrichment of human-machine interactions in a natural language environment. 1 Because a speaker and listener cannot be assured to have the same beliefs, contexts, perceptions, backgrounds, or goals at each point in a conversation, difficulties and mistakes arise when a listener interprets a speaker's utterance. These mistakes can lead to various kinds of misunderstandings between speaker and listener, including reference failures or failure to understand the speaker's intention. We call these misunderstandings miscommunication. Such mistakes can slow, and possibly break down, communication. Our goal is to recognize and isolate such miscommunications and circumvent them. This paper highlights a particular class of miscommunication - reference problems by describing a case study and techniques for avoiding failures of reference. We want to illustrate a framework less restrictive than earlier ones by allowing a speaker leeway in forming an utterance about a task and in determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it. The paper also promotes a new view for extensional reference.</Paragraph>
