ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> To fully understand a sequence of utterances, one must be able to infer implicit relationships between the utterances. Although the identification of sets of utterance relationships forms the basis for many theories of discourse, the formalization and recognition of such relationships has proven to be an extremely difficult computational task.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper presents a plan-based approach to the representation and recognition of implicit relationships between utterances. Relationships are formulated as discourse plans, which allows their representation in terms of planning operators and their computation via a plan recognition process. By incorporating complex inferential processes relating utterances into a plan-based framework, a formalization and computability not available in the earlier works is provided.</Paragraph>
