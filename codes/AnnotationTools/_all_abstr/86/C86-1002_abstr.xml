<Paragraph position="0"> A major problem in a~chine translation is the semantic description of lexical units which should be based on a semantic system that is bot\]l coherent and operationalized to the greatest possible degreedeg This is to guarantee consistency between lexical unii~ coded by lexicogral~lers. This article introduces a generating device for achieving well-formed semantic feature expressions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> I. T ntention and procedure Empirical ~xk with the verbs of the ES~rpus as well as experience in theoretical semantics, and last but not least, the consulting of the semantic feature inventories of other machine translation systems (MII.~AL, JAPAN, SYSTRAN, SUSY) l~ns resulted in the necessity of an elaboration of the proposal for semantic features made in EIB-3 (EUROTRA LIN-GUI~YfC SPECIFICATIONS). These feature inventories as well as a large amount of already existing, partly fairly traditional work on semantic feature systems of linguistics and philosophy (CHAFE, FRIEDRICH, PAIMER, VENDLER) , of information sciences (DAI~BEI~), and work in the field of cog= nitive linguistics and artificial intelligence (G.Ao MI~, G.A.
