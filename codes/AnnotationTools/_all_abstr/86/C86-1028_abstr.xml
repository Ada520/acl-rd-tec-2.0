Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a lexicon-based approach to syntactic analysis, l,exicase, and applies it to a lexicon driven computatlolml parsing system. The basic descriptive mechanism in a l,exicase grammar is lexieal features. The properties of lexieal items are represented by contextual and non-contextual features, and generalizations are expressed as relationships among sets of these features and among sets of lexieal entries. Syntactic tree strue{,uros are representaed as networks of pairwise dependency relationships among the words in a sentence. Possible dependencies are marked as contextual features on individual lexical items, and Lexicase parsing ix a process of picking out words in a string and attaching dependents to them in accordance with their contextual features. Lexiease is an appropriate vehicle for parsing because I,exicase analyses are monostratal, fiat, and relatively non-abstract, and it is well suited to machine translation because grammatical rel)resentations for corresponding smrtences in two languages will Im very similar to each other in structure and inter-constituent relations, and teas far easier to interconvert.</Paragraph>
