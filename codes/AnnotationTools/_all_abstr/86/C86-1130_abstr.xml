Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The development of natural language interfaces to Artificial Intelligence systems is dependent on the representation of knowledge. A major impediment to building such systems has been the difficulty in adding sufficient linguistic and conceptual knowledge to extend and adapt their capabilities. This difficulty has been apparent in systems which perform the task of language production, i. e. the generation of natural language output to satisfy the communicative requirements of a system. The Ace framework applies knowledge representation fundamentals to the task of encoding knowledge about language.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Within this framework, linguistic and conceptual knowledge are organized into hierarchies, and structured associations are used to join knowledge structures that are metaphorically or referentially related. These structured associations permit specialized linguistic knowledge to derive partially from more abstract knowledge, facilitating the use of abstractions in generating specialized phrases. Thls organization, used by a generator called KING (Knowledge INtensive Generator), promotes the extenslbility and adaptability of the generation system.</Paragraph>
