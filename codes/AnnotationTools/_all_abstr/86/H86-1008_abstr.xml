Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A new method is presented for simplifying the logical expressions used to represent utterance meaning in a natural language system. This simplification method utilizes the encoded knowledge and the limited inference-making capability of a taxonomic knowledge representation system to reduce the constituent structure of logical expressions. The specific application is to the problem of mapping expressions of the meaning representation language to a database language capable of retrieving actual responses. Particular account is taken of the model-theoretic aspects of this problem.</Paragraph>
