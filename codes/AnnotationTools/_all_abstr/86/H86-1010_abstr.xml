Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> For natural language understanding systems designed for domains including relatively complex equipment, it is not sufficient to use general knowledge about this equipment.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We show problems which can be solved only if the system has access to a detailed equipment model. We discuss features of such models, in particular, their ability to simulate the equipment's behavior. As an illustration, we describe a simulation model for an air compressor. Finally, we demonstrate how to find referents in ~is model for nominal compounds.</Paragraph>
