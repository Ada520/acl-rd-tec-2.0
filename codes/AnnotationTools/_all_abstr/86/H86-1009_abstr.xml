ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The aim of PROTEUS -- a system for the analysis of short technical texts -- is to increase the reliability of the analysis process through the integration of syntactic and semantic constraints, domain knowledge, and knowledge of discourse structure. This system is initially being applied to the analysis of messages describing the failure, diagnosis, and repair of selected pieces of equipment. This has required us to develop a detailed model of the structure and function of the equipment involved. We focus in this paper on the nature of this model and the roles it plays in the syntactic and semantic analysis of the text.</Paragraph>
