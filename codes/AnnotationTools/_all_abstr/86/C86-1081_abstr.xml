ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Determiners play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance, but they have often been disregarded, perhaps because it seemed more i~portant to devise methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence, even if not in a precise way.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Another problem with determiners is their inherent a~bigulty.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> In this paper we propose a logical formaliem, which, among other things, is suitable fc~ representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear.</Paragraph>
