Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we discuss the formal relationship between the classes of languages generated by Tree Adjoining Grammars and Head Grammars. In particular, we show that Head Languages are included in Tree Adjoining Languages and that Tree Adjoining Grammars are equivalent to a modification of Head Grammars called Modified Head Grammars.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The inclusion of MHL in HL, and thus the equivalence of HG's and TAG's, in the most general case remains to be established.</Paragraph>
