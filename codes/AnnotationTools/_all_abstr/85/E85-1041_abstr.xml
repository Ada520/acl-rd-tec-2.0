ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> we propose a draft scheme of the model formalizing the structure of o~ut~tnicative context in dialogue interaction. The relationships between the interacting partners are considered as system of three automata representing the partners of the dialogue and enviror~ent.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The o~l,nunicative cc~tence of the partners is defined by - the set M of all propositions reflecting the possible states of the three automata within the model; - the set K of &amp;quot;contracts&amp;quot; representing all kinds of htm~nn-to-htm%an relationships (social, interpersonal, professional, etc.) which include fixation of particular roles for the partz~-rs; - the set T of possible topics related to given &amp;quot;contract &amp;quot; The authors believe the system of the notions presented may be used as a basis for forming the communicative component in the dialogue system.</Paragraph>
