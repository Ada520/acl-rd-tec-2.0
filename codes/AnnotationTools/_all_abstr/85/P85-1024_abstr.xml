ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> IntersententAal eAlipti caA utterances occur frequently in information-seeking dielogues. This paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for interpreting such utterances, ~ncluding identAfication of the spoa~r' s discourse ~oel in employing the fra~ent. We claim that the advantage of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone.</Paragraph>
