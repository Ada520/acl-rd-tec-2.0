ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An ATN-Parser is presented with emphasis on the treatment of those phenomena which in the framework of transformational grammar are subsumed under the concept of WH-movement. The approach taken tries to embed these constructions into an ATN grsmmar in a general, linguistically motivated and in terms of the ATN gr~mrn~r formalism descriptive way. To accomplish this goal the approach described incorporates the basic principles governing such constructions as formulated in the framework of the trace theory roposed in the development of the Extended tandard Theory (EST). Thus a ,miffed treatment for both relative clauses and wh-questions is achieved.</Paragraph>
