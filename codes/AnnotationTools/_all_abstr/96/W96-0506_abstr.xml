Abstract

<Paragraph position="0"> This paper 1 introduces a new line of research which ensures soundness and completeness in Natural Language text planners on top of an efficient control strategy. The work builds on the HUNTER-GATItERER analysis system (Beale.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> 96; Beale &amp; Nirenburg, 96). That system employs constraint satisfaction, branch-and-bound and solution synthesis techniques to produce near linear-time processing for knowledge-based semantic analysis. PICARD enables similar results for the field of text planning by recasting localized means-end planning instances into abstractions connected by usage constraints that allow HUNTER-GATHERER to process the global problem as a simple constraint satisfaction problem. PICARD is currently being used to plan Enghsh and Spanish text in the Mikrokosmos Machine Translation Project.</Paragraph>
