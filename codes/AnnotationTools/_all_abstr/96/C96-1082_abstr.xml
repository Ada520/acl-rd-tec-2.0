Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The German joint research project Verbmobil (VM) aims at the deveh)pment of a speech to speech translation system. This paper reports on research done in our group which belongs to Verbmobil's subprojeet on system architectures (TP15). Our specific research areas are the construction of parsers for spontaneous speech, investigations in the parallelization of parsing and to contribute to the development of a flexible communication architecture with distributed control.</Paragraph>
