Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> hfformation structure can be of great use in linguistic applications, especially in those involving a speech component. However, focus marking by prosody is often ambiguous.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Existing theories capture this by rules that produce alternative focus structures. This disjunction is hard to handle computationally. In this paper, a compact, graphically underspecified representation is proposed, along with composition principles and a resolution routine based on context information. null</Paragraph>
