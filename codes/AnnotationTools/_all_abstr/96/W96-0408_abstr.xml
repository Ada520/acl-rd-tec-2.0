Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we discuss how generation issues affect the design of a computer-assisted language learning tool designed to teach written English as a second language to deaf users of American Sign Language. We discuss a dual-component linguistic model that attempts to reflect the generation process of the learners. The first model component captures the influence of the first language on the acquisition of the second. The second model component captures the process of second language acquisition itself.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The linguistic model helps the system identify errors along with their probable source(s). This information is crucial for effective correction. It is also useful in the response phase of the system to focus tutoring on the errors that are most beneficial to correct. In addition, the linguistic model can be used to tailor the system's realization of its response. In this way, the syntactic constructions generated by the system will provide understandable and positive exemplars of the language features currently being acquired by the leamer.</Paragraph>
