<Paragraph position="0"> This paper tbeuses on two disparate as-I)e(:ts of German syntax from the perspeetive of paral\]eJ grammar developmenl;. As part of a eOOl)erative project, we present an innovative approach to auxiliaries and multiph: genitive NPs ill German. The LFG-based imph:menration t)resented here avoids unnessary structural eonq)lexity in the representation of auxiliaries by challenging the traditional analysis of auxiliaries as raising verbs. The approach developed for multiple genitive NPs provides a mor(: at)straet, language independent representati(m of genitives associated with nominalized verl)s. Taken together, the two ai)proa(:hes rei)resent a step (;owards providing uniformly al)plical)le treatments for differing languages, thus lightening the burden for machine translation.</Paragraph>
