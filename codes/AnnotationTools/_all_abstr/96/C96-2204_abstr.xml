Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we study a reformulation, which is better adapted to NLP, of the alternation system developed for English by B. Levin. We have studied a set of 1700 verbs from which we explain how verb semantic classes can be built in a systematic way. The quality of the results w.r.t, semantic chLssifications such as WordNet is then evaluated.</Paragraph>
