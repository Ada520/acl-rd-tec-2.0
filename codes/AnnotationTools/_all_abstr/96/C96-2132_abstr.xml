</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a method of the zero pronoun resohition, which is one of the essential processes in understanding systems for Japanese manual sentences. It is based on pragmatic properties of Japanese conditionals. We examined a uumber of sentences appearing in Japanese manuals according to the classillcation based on the types of agent and the types of verb phrase. As ~ result, we obtained the following pattern of usage in matrix clauses: 1) The connective particles TO and REBA have tt, e same distribution of usage. TARA and NARA have the same distribution of usage. 2) '\['he distribution of usage of TO and REBA, and that of TARA and NARA are complementary to each other. We show that these distributions of usage can be used for resolution of zero subjects.</Paragraph>
