Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe and experimentally evaluate a system, FeasPar, that learns parsing spontaneous speech. To train and run FeasPar (Feature Structure Parser), only limited handmodeled knowledge is required.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The FeasPar architecture consists of neural networks and a search. The networks spilt the incoming sentence into chunks, which are labeled with feature values and chunk relations. Then, the search finds the most probable and consistent feature structure.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> FeasPar is trained, tested and evaluated with the Spontaneous Schednling Task, and compared with a handmodeled LRparser. The handmodeling effort for FeasPar is 2 weeks. The handmodeling effort for the LR-parser was 4 months.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> FeasPar performed better than the LR-parser in all six comparisons that are made.</Paragraph>
