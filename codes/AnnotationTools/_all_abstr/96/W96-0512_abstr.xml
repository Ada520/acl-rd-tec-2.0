</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a system that incorporates agent-based technology and natural language generation to address the problem of natural language summarization of live sources of data. The input to the system includes newswire and on-fine databases and ontologies. The output consists of short summaries that convey information selected to fit the user's interests, the most recent news updates, and historical information. The system is under development.</Paragraph>
