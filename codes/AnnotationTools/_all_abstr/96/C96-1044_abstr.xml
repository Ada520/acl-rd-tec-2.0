Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe two &amp;quot;semantically-oriented&amp;quot; dependency-structure formalisms, t J-forms and S-forms. U-forms have heen previously used in nmchine translation as interlingual representations, hut without being provided with a formal interpretation. S-forms, which we introduce in this paper, are a scoped vet sion of U-fnrms, and we define a compositional semantics mechanism for them. Two types of semantic composition are basic: complement incorlgoration and modifier incorporation. Binding of variables is done at tire time of incorporation, permitting tnttch \[lexibility in composition order and a simple account of the semantic effects of permuting several incorporations.</Paragraph>
