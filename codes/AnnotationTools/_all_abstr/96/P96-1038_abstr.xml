Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports on corpus-based research into the relationship between intonational variation and discourse structure. We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship. We also compare the acoustic-prosodic features of initial, medial, and final utterances in a discourse segment. null</Paragraph>
