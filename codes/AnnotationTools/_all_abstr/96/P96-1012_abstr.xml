Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper 1 we present a new parsing algorithm for linear indexed grammars (LIGs) in the same spirit as the one described in (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) for tree adjoining grammars. For a LIG L and an input string x of length n, we build a non ambiguous context-free grammar whose sentences are all (and exclusively) valid derivation sequences in L which lead to x. We show that this grammar can be built in (9(n 6) time and that individual parses can be extracted in linear time with the size of the extracted parse tree.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Though this O(n 6) upper bound does not improve over previous results, the average case behaves much better. Moreover, practical parsing times can be decreased by some statically performed computations.</Paragraph>
