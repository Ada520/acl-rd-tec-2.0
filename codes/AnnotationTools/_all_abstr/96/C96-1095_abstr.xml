Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Since treebanks have become available to researchers a wide variety of techniques has been used to make broad coverage parsing systems. This makes quantitative evaluation very important, but the current evaluation methods have a number of drawbacks such as arbitrary choices in the treebank and the difficulty in measuring statistical significance. We suggest a more detailed method for testing a parsing system using constituent boundaries, with a number of measures that give more information than current measures, and evaluate the quality of the test. We also show that statistical significance cannot be calculated in a straight-forward way, and suggest a calculation method for the case of Bracket Recall.</Paragraph>
