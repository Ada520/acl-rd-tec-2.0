</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Various strategies are proposed to identify and classify three types of proper nouns in Chinese texts. Clues from character, sentence and paragraph levels are employed to resolve Chinese personal names.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Character, Syllable and Frequency Conditions are presented to treat transliterated personal names, To deal with organization names, keywords, prefix, word association and parts-of-speech are applied. For fair evaluation, large scale test data are selected from six sections of a newspaper.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The precision and the recall for these three types are (88.04%, 92.56%), (50.62%, 71.93%) and (61.79%, 54.50%), respectively.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> When the former two types are regarded as a category, the performance becomes (81.46%, 91.22%). Compared with other approaches, our approach has better performance and our classification is automatic.</Paragraph>
