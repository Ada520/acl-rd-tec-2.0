Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present an evaluation of anaphors generated by a Chinese natural language generation system. In the evaluation work, the anaphors in five test texts generated by three test systems employing generation rules with different complexities ~vere compared with the ones in the same texts created by twelve native speakers of Chinese. We took the average number of anaphors matching between the machine and human texts as a measure of the quality of anaphors generated by the test systems. The results suggest that the one we have chosen and which has the most complex rule is better than the other two. There axe, however, real difficulties in establishing the significance of the results because of the degree of disagreement among the native speakers.</Paragraph>
