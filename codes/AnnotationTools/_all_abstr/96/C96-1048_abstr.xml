Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The experiments described here have been done in connection with the LS-GRAM project, which is concerned with the development of large scale grammars and thus foreseen the coverage of &amp;quot;real life texts&amp;quot;. But in order to deal with such texts, it is also necessary to process linguistic units which are larger than sentences. The resolution of cross-sentential anaphora is one of the problems we have to deal with, when we switch towards the analysis of such larger linguistic units.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In order to propose an analysis of the cross-sentential anaphora, one has to be able to refer back to an antecedent, which is to be found in a preceding sentence. This will be done on the basis of an information-passing framework. Using also the simple unification technique a resolution of the pronoun can then be tried out: parts of the content information of the pronoun are going to be compared (unified) with specific parts of the content information of the (possible) antecedent.</Paragraph>
