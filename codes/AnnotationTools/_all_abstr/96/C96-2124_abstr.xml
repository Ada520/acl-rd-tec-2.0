Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Automated text generation requires a underlying knowledge base fl'om which to generate, which is often difficult to produce. Software documentation is one domain in which parts of this knowledge base may be derived automatically. In this paper, we describe DRAFTER, an authoring support tool for generating user-centred software documentation, and in particular, we describe how parts of its required knowledge base can be obtained automatically.</Paragraph>
