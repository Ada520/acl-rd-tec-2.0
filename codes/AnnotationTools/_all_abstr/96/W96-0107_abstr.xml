Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a method of finding correspondences of arbitrary length word sequences in aligned parallel corpora of Japanese and English. Translation candidates of word sequences are evaluated by a similarity measure between the sequences defined by the co-occurrence frequency and independent frequency of the word sequences. The similarity measure is an extension of Dice coefficient. An iterative method with gradual threshold lowering is proposed for getting a high quality translation dictionary. The method is tested with parallel corpora of three distinct domains and achieved over 80~0 accuracy.</Paragraph>
