Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a system for generating text abstracts which relies on a general, purely statistical principle, i.e., on the notion of &amp;quot;relevance&amp;quot;, as it is defined in terms of the combination of tf*idf weights of words in a sentence. The system generates abstracts from newspaper articles by selecting the &amp;quot;most relevant&amp;quot; sentences and combining them in text order. Since neither domain knowledge nor text-sort-specific heuristics are involved, this system provides maximal generality and flexibility.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Also, it is fast and can be efficiently ilnplemented for both on-line and off-line purposes. An experiment shows that recall and precision for the extracted sentences (taking the sentences extracted by human subjects as a baseline) is within the same range as recall/precision when the human subjects are coinpared amongst each other: this means in fact that tile performance of the system is indistinguishable from the performance of a human abstractor. Finally, the system yields significantly better results than a default &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; algorithm does which chooses just some initial sentences from the text.</Paragraph>
