1 INTRODUCTION
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Erie is a name recognition system developed for the Multilingual Entity Task (MET) in MUC-6.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The pattern matching engine recognizes organization, person, and place names along with time and numeric expressions in Japanese text. Although our previous information extraction system Textract performed well in MUC-5, the pattern matching engine, which was written in AWK language, was slow\[2\]. System maintenance was also difficult, since the patterns were defined in both the matching engine and the pattern files. Erie solves these problems by generating a pattern matching engine in C language directly from the defined patterns.</Paragraph>
