Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We study the computational complexity of the parsing problem of a variant of Lambek Categorial Grammar that we call semidirectional. In semidirectional Lambek calculus SD\[ there is an additional non-directional abstraction rule allowing the formula abstracted over to appear anywhere in the premise sequent's left-hand side, thus permitting non-peripheral extraction. SD\[ grammars are able to generate each context-free language and more than that. We show that the parsing problem for semidireetional Lambek Grammar is NP-complete by a reduction of the 3-Partition problem.</Paragraph>
