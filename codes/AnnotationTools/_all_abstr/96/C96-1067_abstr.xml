Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We argue that the conventional approach to Interactive Machine ~Ih-anslation is not the best way to provide assistance to skilled translators, and propose an alternative whose central feature is the use of the target text as a medium of interaction. We describe an automatic wordcompletion system intended to serve as a vehicle for exploring the feasibility of this new approach, and give results in terms of keystrokes saved in a test corpus.</Paragraph>
