Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We have proposed an incremental translation method in Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT). In this method, constituent boundary patterns are applied to an input in a bottom-up fashion. Also, by dealing with best-only substructures, the explosion of structural ambiguity is constrained and an efficient translation of a lengthy input can be achieved. Through preliminary experimentation our new TDMT has been shown to be more efficient while maintMning translation quality.</Paragraph>
