</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a bidirectional framework for natural language parsing and generation, using a typed feature formalism and an HPSG-based grammar with a parser and generator derived from parallel processing algorithms. We present an approach to delayed lexical choice in generation, based on subsumption within the sort hierarchy, using a lexicon of nnderinstantiated signs which at'(; derived fi'om the normal lexicon by lexical rules. We then show how delayed lexical choice can be used in parsing, so that some types of ill-formed inputs can be parsed, but well-formed outputs are generated, using the same shared linguistic information.</Paragraph>
