Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Comparisons are typically employed to distinguish similar entities, or to illustrate a prop-erty of an entity by referring to another com* monly known entity which shares that property. Based on an analysis of a corpus of encyclopaedia texts, we define three types of comparisons and outline some strategies for applying these in the generation of entity descriptions. We describe how these comparison strategies are used within the PEBA-II hypertext generation system to generate descriptions of animals.</Paragraph>
