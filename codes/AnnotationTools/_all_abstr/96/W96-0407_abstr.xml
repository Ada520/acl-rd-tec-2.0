Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Patent claims are the subject of legal protection. They must be formulated according to a set of precise syntactic, lexical and stylistic guidelines. Composing patent claims is a complex task, even for experts. In this paper we report about an tmplemented system for supporting authoring claims for patents describing apparatuses. The system generates claim texts from the input specified partly by the stored conceptual text schemata and partly by the input from the user. The result of the interactive content acquisition stage is a shaUow-level representation which can be considered a draft to be automatically revised into the final text of the claim.</Paragraph>
