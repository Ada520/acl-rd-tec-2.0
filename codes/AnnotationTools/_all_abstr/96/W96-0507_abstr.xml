<Paragraph position="0"> AlethGen is ERLI's automatic multi-paragraph text-generation toolbox. It was first specified in 1992 and the French version developed in 19931994. The English version has been under development since 1995. The Spanish version is planned for 1997.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> AlethGen has already been used for generating texts in several applications, notably for producing correspondence for a leading French mail-order company (see \[Coch &amp; David 94\], \[Coch, David &amp; Magnoler 95\]).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> AlethGen is much more than a sentence generator. Its main characteristics are: * the high quality of the multi-paragraph texts generated, an terms of fluidity, understandability, and personalisation, and * the data-driven planning approach, which allows applications to produce an extensive set of different text structures.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> AlethGen is an industrial toolbox that uses several techniques in a hybrid way, i.e. it has several modules which can be integrated and used in different ways to meet different applications' requirements. The modules are described in Chapter 2, and the architectures in Chapter 3. Given that AlethGen is used in commercial and industrial projects, it is important to describe the characteristics of the systems it has been used to build, in terms of quality criteria and performance (Chapter 4).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Finally, the existing projects using AlethGen are described in Chapter 5.</Paragraph>
