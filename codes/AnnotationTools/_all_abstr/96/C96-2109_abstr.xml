Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes an operational semantics for DATR theories. The semantics is presented as a set of inference rules that axiomatises the evaluation relationship for DATR expressions. The inference rules provide a clear picture of the way in which DATR works, and should lead to a better understanding of the mathematical and computational properties of the language.</Paragraph>
