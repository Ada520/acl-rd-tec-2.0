Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper presents the Constructive Dialogue Model as a new approach to formulate system goals in intelligent dialogue systems. The departure point is in general communicative principles which constrain cooperative and coherent communication. Dialogue participants are engaged in a cooperative task whereby a model of the joint purpose is constructed. Contributions are planned as reactions to the changing context, and no dialogue grammar is needed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Also speech act classification is abandoned, in favour of contextual reasoning and rationality considerations.</Paragraph>
