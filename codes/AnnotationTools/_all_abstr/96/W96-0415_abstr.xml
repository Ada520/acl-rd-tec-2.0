Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We sketch the architecture of a sentence generation module that maps a language-neutral &amp;quot;deep&amp;quot; representation to a language-specific sentence-semantic specification, which is given to a front-end generator. Lexicalizat, ion is tlm main instrument tbr the mapl~ing step, and we examine the role of verb semantics in the process. In particular, we propose a set of rules that derive a range of verb alternations from a single base form, which is one source of lexical paraphrasing in the system.</Paragraph>
