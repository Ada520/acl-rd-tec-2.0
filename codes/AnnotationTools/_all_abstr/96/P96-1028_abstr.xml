<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a quantitative evaluation of the portability to the stock market domain of the revision rule hierarchy used by the system STREAK to incrementally generate newswire sports summaries. The evaluation consists of searching a test corpus of stock market reports for sentence pairs whose (semantic and syntactic) structures respectively match the triggering condition and application result of each revision rule. The results show that at least 59% of all rule classes are fully portable, with at least another 7% partially portable.</Paragraph>
