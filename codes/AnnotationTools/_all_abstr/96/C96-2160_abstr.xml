<Paragraph position="0"> This t)ai)er deseril)es techniques to compile lexical entries in IIPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1.987; Poll;ml and Sag, 1993)-style grammar into a set of finite state automata. The states in automat~L are possible signs derived fl'om h',xical entries and contaili information raised fl'om the lexical entries. The automatt~ are augmented with feature structures use(l by a partial unification routine and delayed/frozen definite el;rose programs.</Paragraph>
