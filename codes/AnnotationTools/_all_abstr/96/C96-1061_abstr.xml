Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we discuss how we allply discourse predictions along with non context-based predictions to the problem of parse disambiguation in Enthusiast, a Spanish-to-English translation system (Woszcyna et al., 1993; Snhm et al., 1994; Levin el; al., 1995). We discuss extensions to our plan-based discourse processor in order to make this possible. We evaluate those extensions and demonstrate the advantage of exploiting context-based predictions over a purely non context-based approach.</Paragraph>
