Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> I examine how terminological languages can be used to manage linguistic data during NL research and development. In particular, I consider the lexical semantics task of characterizing semantic verb classes and show how the language can be extended to flag inconsistencies in verb class definitions, identify the need for new verb classes, and identify appropriate linguistic hypotheses for a new verb's behavior.</Paragraph>
