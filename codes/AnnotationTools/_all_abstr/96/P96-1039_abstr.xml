Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an architecture for the generation of spoken monologues with contextually appropriate intonation. A two-tiered information structure representation is used in the high-level content planning and sentence planning stages of generation to produce efficient, coherent speech that makes certain discourse relationships, such as explicit contrasts, appropriately salient.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The system is able to produce appropriate intonational patterns that cannot be generated by other systems which rely solely on word class and given/new distinctions.</Paragraph>
