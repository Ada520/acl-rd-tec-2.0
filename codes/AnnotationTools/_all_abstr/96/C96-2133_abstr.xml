Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In the spoken language machine translation project Verbmobil, the semantic formalism Language for Underspecified Discourse representation structures (LUD) is used. LUD describes a number of DRSs and allows for underspecification of scopal ambiguities. Dealing with Japanese-to-English translation besides German-to-English poses challenging problems. In this paper, a treatment of multiple discourse relation constructions on the sentential level is discussed. These are common in Japanese but cause a problem for the formalism. It is shown that the underspecification is to be represented for them, too. Additionally, it is possible to state a semantic constraint on the resolution of multiple discourse relations which seems to prevail over the syntactic c-command constraint.</Paragraph>
