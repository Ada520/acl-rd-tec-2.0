Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The focus of this article is the integration of two different perspectives on lexical semantics: Discourse Representation Theory's (DRT) inferentially motivated approach and Semantic Emphasis Theory's (SET) lexical field based view. A new joined representation format is developed which is exemplified by analyses of German verbs. The benefits thereof are on both sides. DI/T gains basic entries for whole lexical fields and, furtherlnore, a systematic interface between semantic and syntactic argument structures. SET profits both from the much larger semantic coverage and from the fine grained lexical analyses which reflect inferential behaviour.</Paragraph>
