Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Graphics and text have to be well integrated in order to achieve their full potential. A picture shows but a text describes. In a statistical report, graphics show the data that is analyzed in the text. This paper describes a system, called PostGraphe, which generates a report integrating graphics and text from a single set of writer's intentions. The system is given the data in tabular form as might be found in a spreadsheet; also input is a declaration of the types of values in the columns of the table. The user chooses the intentions to be conveyed in the graphics (e.g. compare two variables, show the evolution of a set of variables ...) and the system generates a report in IgTEX with the appropriate PostScript graphic files.</Paragraph>
