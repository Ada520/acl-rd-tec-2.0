Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We have proposed a method of machine translation, which acquires translation rules from translation examples using inductive learning, and have evaluated the method. And we have confirmed that the method requires many translation examples. To resolve this problem, we applied genetic algorithms to the method. In this paper, we describe our method with genetic algorithms and evaluated it by some experiments. We confirmed that the accuracy rate of translation increased from 52.8% to 61.9% by applying genetic algorithms.</Paragraph>
