<Paragraph position="0"> Unknown words are inevitable at any step of analysis in natural language processing. Wc propose a method to extract words from a corl)us and estimate the probability that each word belongs to given parts of speech (POSs), using a distributional analysis. Our experiments have shown that this method is etfective for inferring the POS of unknown words.</Paragraph>
