Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> I describe a very simple HPSG analysis for partial verb phrase fronting. I will argue that the presented account is more adequate than others made during the past years because it allows the description of constituents in fronted positions with their modifier remaining in the non-fronted part of the sentence.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A problem with ill-formed signs that are admitted by all HPSG accounts for partial verb phrase fronting known so far will be explained and a solution will be suggested that uses the difference between combinatoric relations of signs and their representation in word order domains. null</Paragraph>
