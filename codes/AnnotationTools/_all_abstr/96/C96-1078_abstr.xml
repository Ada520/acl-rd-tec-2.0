Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Research in example-based machine translation (F,I~MT) has been hampered by the lack of efficient tree alignment algorithms for bilingual corpora. *ghis paper &lt;lescribes an alignment algorithm for F,I~MT whose running time is quadratic in tile size of the input parse trees. 'Phe algorithm uses dynamic programming to score all possible matching nodes between structure-sharing trees or forests.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We describe the algorithm, various optimizations, and onr implementation.</Paragraph>
