<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a mefllod for ~malyzing Japanese double-subject constniction having an adjective predicate based on the valency structure. A simple sentence usually has only one subjective case in most languages.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> However, lnmly Japancse adjeclivcs (and some verbs) can dominate two surface subjective cases within a simple sentence. Such sentence structure is called lhe double-subject construction. This paper classifies lhe Japtulese double-subject constntction inlo four types mid describes problems arising when analyzing fllcse lypes using orditmry Japmlese construction approaches. This paper proposes a method tbr analyzing a Japanese double-subject construction having an adjective predicate in order to overcome lhe problems described. By applying tiffs melhod to Jap~mese senlence ,'malysis in Japanese-to-English machine ~,mslalion systems, tl'm~slalion accuracy can be improved because tiffs melhod eml analyze correclly the double-subject construction.</Paragraph>
