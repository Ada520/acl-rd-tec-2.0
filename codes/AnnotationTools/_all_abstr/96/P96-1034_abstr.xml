Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In transformation-based parsing, a finite sequence of tree rewriting rules are checked for application to an input structure. Since in practice only a small percentage of rules are applied to any particular structure, the naive parsing algorithm is rather inefficient. We exploit this sparseness in rule applications to derive an algorithm two to three orders of magnitude faster than the standard parsing algorithm.</Paragraph>
