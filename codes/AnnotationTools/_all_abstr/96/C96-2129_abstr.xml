Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> ADOMIT is an algorithln for Automatic Detection of OMissions in Translations. The algorithm relies solely on geometric analysis of bitext maps and uses no linguistic information. This property allows it to deal equally well with omissions that do not correspond to linguistic units, such as might result ti'om word-processing mishaps.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> ADOMIT has proven itself by discovering many errors in a hand-constructed gold standard for evaluating bitext mapping algorithms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Quantitative evaluation on simulated omissions showed that, even with today's poor bitext mapping technology, ADOMIT is a valuable quality control tool for translators and translation bureaus.</Paragraph>
