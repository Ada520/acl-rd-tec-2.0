Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> 'Fhis l)aper presents a pruning technique which can bc used to reduce the number of paths searched in rule-based b~g generators of the type proposed by (Poznafiski el; al., 1!)95) and (l'opowMl, 1995). Pruning the search space in these generators is important given the. computational cost of bag generation. 'rhe technique relies on a connectivity constraint between the semantic indices associated with each lexical sign in a ba R.</Paragraph>
