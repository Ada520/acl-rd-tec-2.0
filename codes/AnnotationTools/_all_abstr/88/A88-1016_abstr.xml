ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we introduce MULTIVOC, a real-world text-to-speech product geared to the French language.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Starting from a ordinary French text, MULTIVOC generates in real-time a high quality speech using a synthesis-by-diphone method. The processing is divided into 3 main transformations (phonetization, automatic prosody and rhythm marking, and generation of LPC frames).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> This paper provides a full description of MULTIVOC including not only the technical view but also some applications of the product within the real world.</Paragraph>
