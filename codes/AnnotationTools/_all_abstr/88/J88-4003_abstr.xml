THE BERKELEY UNIX CONSULTANT PROJECT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> UC (UNIX Consultant) is an intelligent, natural language interface that allows naive users to learn about the UNIX 2 operating system. UC was undertaken because the task was thought to be both a fertile domain for artificial intelligence (AI) research and a useful application of AI work in planning, reasoning, natural language processing, and knowledge representation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The current implementation of UC comprises the following components: a language analyzer, called ALANA, produces a representation of the content contained in an utterance; an inference component, called a concretion mechanism, that further refines this content; a goal analyzer, PAGAN, that hypothesizes the plans and goals under which the user is operating; an agent, called UCEgo, that decides on UC's goals and proposes plans for them; a domain planner, called KIP, that computes a plan to address the user's request; an expression mechanism, UCExpress, that determines the content to be communicated to the user, and a language production mechanism, UCGen, that expresses UC's response in English.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> UC also contains a component, called KNOME, that builds a model of the user's knowledge state with respect to UNIX. Another mechanism, UCTeacher, allows a user to add knowledge of both English vocabulary and facts about UNIX to UC's knowledge base. This is done by interacting with the user in natural language.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> All these aspects of UC make use of knowledge represented in a knowledge representation system called KODIAK. KODIAK is a relation-oriented system that is intended to have wide representational range and a clear semantics, while maintaining a cognitive appeal. All of UC's knowledge, ranging from its most general concepts to the content of a particular utterance, is represented in KODIAK.</Paragraph>
