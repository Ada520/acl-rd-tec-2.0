</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> /S0aanes 1979/provides some counterexamples to the theory of natural language presuppositions that is presented in /Gazdar 1979/.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> /Soames 1982/ provides a theory which explains these eounterexamples. /Mercer 1987/ rejects the solution found in/Soames 1982/ leaving these eounterexamples unexplained. By reappraising these insightful counterexamples, the inferential theory for natural language presuppositions described in/Mercer 1987, 1988/gives a simple and straightforward explanation for the presupposiitional nature of these sentences.</Paragraph>
