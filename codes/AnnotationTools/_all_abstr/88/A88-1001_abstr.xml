Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a domain independent strategy for the multimedia articulation of answers elicited by a natural language interface to database query applications. Multimedia answers include videodisc images and heuristically-produced complete sentences in text or text-to-speech form. Deictic reference and feedback about the discourse are enabled. The interface thus presents the application as cooperative and conversational.</Paragraph>
