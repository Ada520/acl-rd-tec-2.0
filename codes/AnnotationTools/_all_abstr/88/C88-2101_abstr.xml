Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an attempt to construct a feed-back systenr PECOF which improves a Japauese-English Machine Translation system by feedback of correcting information given by posteditors. PECOF analyzes the error-correcting information by using an English-Japmmse Machine Translation system which works in the reverse direction to the original MT sys~ tern, corot)ares the intermediate expressions of the corrected patterns with those of the erroneous parts of the originai MT output at every transfer stage and idenLifies the responsible parts of the original Japanese-English M'P system. Then PECOF corrects the irrelevant parts of tt,e database or adds error correcting patterns to a document of postediting to ask users for further exmninations for corrections.</Paragraph>
