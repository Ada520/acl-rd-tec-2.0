Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we propose a new method to express quantification and especially quantifier scope in French generation. Our approach is based on two points: the identification of the sentence components between which quantifier scope can indeed be expressed and a mechanism to reinforce the expression of quantifier scope. This approach is being integrated in a written French generator , called Hermes, which will become the generator of a portable natural language interface.</Paragraph>
