Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A method is proposed for storing a finite vocabulary in a manner which makes it convenient to recognize words and substrings of words. The representation, which can be generated automatically from a list of words or from given representations of other sets by means of which the vocabulary has been defined through set or string operations, has the form of a modified finite-state grammar, a form eliminating the multiplicative effects of conjunction, complementation, etc., on the node sets of conventional finite-state representations.</Paragraph>
