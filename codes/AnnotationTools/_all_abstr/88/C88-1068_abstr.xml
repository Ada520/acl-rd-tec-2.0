<Paragraph position="0"> In the present paper communicative cycle (CC) is considered as a dialog arising between two partners during solving a problem. Communicative strategy (C5) is seen as a general scheme by which a dialog participant is guided in achieving his goal.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> CC is described in terms of the goals of the participants and CS.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> I, Introduction Dialog is a bilateral process the par ~ ticipants of which communicate each other messages concerning the surrounding world. Each participant interchangingly undertakes the role of the author or the recipient.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> For communication to be possible the communicants must understand each other, i.e. %halt knowledge of language and about the world must have a shared part. Each participant should also know something about the partner - his goals, knowledge, possibilities, etc.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> The task of a dialog model is a formal description of the process of communication or, in a narrower sense, description of the communicative structure of the text (speech) generated by the communicants in this process. Such description may be represented, for example, in the form of a generative grammar or graph /Robinson 1982, Metzlng 1981/ and it can be realized on a computer.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> One of the aims of working out the dialog models is just to facilitate the communication of man with the computer, bringing it nearer to man-to-man communication.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> Next we consider some problems arising in simulating dialog interaction.</Paragraph>
