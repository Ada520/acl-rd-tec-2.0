Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a prototype news analysis system Which classifies and indexes news stories in real time. The system extracts stories from a newswire, parses the sentences of the story, and then maps the syntactic structures into a concept base. This process results in an index containing both ger~eral categories and specific details.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Central to this system is a Government-Binding parser which processes each sentence of a news item. The system is completely modular and can be interfaced with different news feeds or concept bases.</Paragraph>
