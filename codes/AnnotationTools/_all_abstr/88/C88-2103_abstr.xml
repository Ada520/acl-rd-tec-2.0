</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In order to increase parsing efficiency in a real-time on-line translation system interfaced with a keyboard conversation program, we have developed a version of the ATN formalism with a look-ahead function. By permitting future input to be scanned, arcs can be reordered or suppressed. Various mechanisms utilizing this capability are presented.</Paragraph>
