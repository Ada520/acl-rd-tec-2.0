ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We apply a complexity theoretic notion of feasible learnability called &amp;quot;polynomial learnabillty&amp;quot; to the evaluation of grammatical formalisms for linguistic description. We show that a novel, nontriviai constraint on the degree of ~locMity&amp;quot; of grammars allows not only context free languages but also a rich d~s of mildy context sensitive languages to be polynomiaily learnable. We discuss possible implications, of this result t O the theory of naturai language acquisition.</Paragraph>
