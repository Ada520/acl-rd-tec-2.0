Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In natural communication situations, multimodal referent specification is frequent and efficient. The linguistic component are deictic expressions, e.g. 'this' and 'here'. Extralinguistic devices in dialogs are different body movements, mainly pointing gestures. Their functional equivalent in texts are means like arrows and indices.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper has two intentions. First, it discusses the advantages of multimodal reference in interhuman communication which motivate the integration of extralinguistic &amp;quot;pointing&amp;quot; devices into NL dialog systems. The generation of multimodal output poses specific problems, which have no counterpart in the analysis of multimodal input. The second part presents the strategy for generating multimodal output which has been developed within the framework of the XTRA system (a NL access system to expert systems). XTRA allows the combination of verbal descriptions and pointing gestures in order to specify elements of the given visual context, i.e. a form displayed on the screen. The component POPEL generates referential expressions which may be accompanied by a pointing gesture. The appearance of these gestures depends on several factors, e.g. the type of referent (whether it is a region or an entry of the form) and its complexity.</Paragraph>
