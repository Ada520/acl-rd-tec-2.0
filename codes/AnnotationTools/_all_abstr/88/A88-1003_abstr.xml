ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe the pronominal anaphora resolution module of Lucy, a portable English understanding system. The design of this mo;clule was motivated by the observation that, although there exist many theories of anaphora resolution, no one of these theories is complete. Thus we have implemented a blackboard-like architecture in which individual partial theories can be encoded as separate modules that can interact to propose candidate antecedents and to evaluate each other's proposals.</Paragraph>
