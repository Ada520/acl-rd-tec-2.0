Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a system for representing knowledge about conventional metaphors for use by natural language analysis, generation and acquisition systems. A system of hierarchically related structured associations is used. These associations are implemented as a part of the KODIAK representation language. Particular attention is paid in this paper to representational mechanisms that can capture generalizations over the system of conventional metaphors as a whole.</Paragraph>
