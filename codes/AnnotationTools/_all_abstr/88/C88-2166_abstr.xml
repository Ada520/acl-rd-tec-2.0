</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Although every natural language system needs a computational lexicon, each system puts different amounts and types of information into its lexicon according to its individual needs. However, some of the intonnation needed across systems is shared or &amp;quot;identical&amp;quot; information. This paper presents our experienc~&amp;quot; in planning and building COMPLEX, a computational lexicon designed to be a repository of shared lexical information for use by Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. We have drawn primarily on explicit and implicit information fi'om machlne-readable dictionaries (MRD's) to create a broad coverage lexicon.</Paragraph>
