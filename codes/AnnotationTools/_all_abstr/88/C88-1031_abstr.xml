Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We are developing stylistic grammars to provide the basis for a French and English stylistic parser.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our stylistic grammar is a branching stratificational model, built upon a foundation dealing with lexical, syntactic, and semantic stylistic realizations. Its central level uses a vocabulary of constituent stylistic elements common to both English and French, while the top level correlates stylistic goals, such as clarity and concreteness, with patterns of these elements.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Overall, we are implementing a computational schema of stylistics in French-to-English translation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> We believe that the incorporation of stylistic analysis into machine translation systems will significantly reduce the current reliance on human post-editing and improve the quality of the systems' output.</Paragraph>
