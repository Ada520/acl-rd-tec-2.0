Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A new approach for Interactive Machine Translation where the author interacts during the creation or the modification of the document is proposed. The explanation of an ambiguity or an error for the purposes of correction does not use any concepts of the underlying linguistic theory : it is a reformulation of the erroneous or ambiguous sentence. The interaction is limited to the analysis step of the translation process.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper presents a new interactive disambiguation scheme based on the paraphrasing of a parser's multiple output. Some examples of paraphrasing ambiguous sentences are presented.</Paragraph>
