Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We discuss the techniques we have developed and implemented for the cross-categorial treatment of comparatives in TELl, a natural language question-answering system that's transportable among both application domains and types of backend retrieval systems. For purposes of illustration, we shall consider the example sentences &amp;quot;List the cars at least 20 inches more than twice as long as the Century is wide&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Have any US companies made at least 3 more large cars than Buick?&amp;quot; Issues to be considered include comparative inflections, left recursion and other forms of nesting, extraposition of comparative complements, ellipsis, the wh element &amp;quot;how', and the translation of normalized parse trees into logical form.</Paragraph>
