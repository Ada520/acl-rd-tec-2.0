Abstract

<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present an inference mechanism called the integrated parsing engine which provides a uniform abductive inference mech-anism for natu~al language understmlding. It can (1) make phmsibh, assmnptiox~s, (2) rea~.</Paragraph>

We demonstrafe that a .natural language understanding system using the integrated parsing engine as a subsystem can pursue a guided search for most t)lausible interpretation by making use of syntax, semantics, and contextual information.</Paragraph>
