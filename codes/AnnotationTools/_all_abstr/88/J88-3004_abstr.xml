RECOGNIZING AND RESPONDING TO PLAN-ORIENTED MISCONCEPTIONS
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses the problem of recognizing and responding to plan-oriented misconceptions in advice-seeking dialogs, concentrating on the problems of novice computer users. A cooperative response is one that not only corrects the user's mistaken belief, but also addresses the missing or mistaken user beliefs that led to it. Responding appropriately to a potentially incorrect user belief is presented as a process of 1. checking whether the advisor holds the user's belief; 2. confirming the belief as a misconception by finding an explanation for why the advisor does not hold this belief; 3. detecting the mistaken beliefs underlying the misconception by trying to explain why the user holds the incorrect belief, and 4. providing these explanations to the user. An explanation is shown to correspond to a set of advisor beliefs, and searching for an explanation to proving whether various abstract configurations of advisor beliefs hold. A taxonomy of domain-independent explanations for potential user misconceptions involving plan applicability conditions, preconditions, and effects is presented.</Paragraph>
