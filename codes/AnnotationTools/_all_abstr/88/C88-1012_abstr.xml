Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Even though progress in theoretical linguistics does not necessarily rely on the construction of working programs, a large proportion of current research in syntactic theory is facilitated by suitable computational tools. However, when natural language processing applications seek to draw on the results from new developments in theories of grammar, not only the nature of the tools has to change, but they face the challenge of reconciling the seemingly contradictory requirements of notational perspicuity and efficiency of performance.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, we present a comparison and an evaluation of a number of software systems for grammar development, and argue that they are inadequate as practical tools for building wide-coverage grammars. We discuss a number of factors characteristic of this task, demonstrate how they influence the design of a suitable software environment, and describe the implementation of a system which has supported efficient development of a large computational grammar of English?</Paragraph>
