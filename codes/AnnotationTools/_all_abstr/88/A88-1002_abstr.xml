Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a pilot version of a commercial application of natural language processing techniques to the problem of categorizing news stories into broad topic categories. The system does not perform a complete semantic or syntactic analyses of the input stories. Its categorizations are dependent on fragmentary recognition using pattern-matching techniques. The fragments it looks for are determined by a set of knowledge-based rules. The accuracy of the system is only slightly lower than that of human categorizers.</Paragraph>
