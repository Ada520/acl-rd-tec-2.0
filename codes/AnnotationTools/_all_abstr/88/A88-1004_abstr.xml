</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We report about the current status of the SEMSYN generation system. This system - initially implemented within a Japanese to German MT project - has been applied to a variety of generation tasks both within MT and text generation. We will work out how these applications enhanced the system's capacities. In addition to the paper we will give a demo of both the German and a recently implemented English version of the system.</Paragraph>
