SEARCH AND INFERENCE STRATEGIES IN
PRONOUN RESOLUTION : AN E~ERIMENTAL STUDY
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The qusstlun of how people resolve pronouns has the various factors combine.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> been of interest to language theorists for a long time because so much of what goes on when people find referents for pronouns seems to lie at the heart of comprehension. However, despite the relevance of pronouns for comprehension and language cheorT, the processes chat contribute to pronoun resolution have proved notoriously difficult Co pin down.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Part of the difficulty arises from the wide range of fac=ors that can affect which antecedent noun phrase in a tex~ is usderstood to be co-referentlal with a particular pronoun. These factors can range from simple number/gender agreement through selectional rescrlc~ions co quite complex &amp;quot;knowledge chat has been acquired from the CaxC (see Webber, (1978) for a neatly illustrated description of many of these factors). Research in psychology, artificial intelligence a~d linguistics has gone a long way toward identifying some of these factors and their role in pronoun resolu~ion. For instance, in psychology, research carried ouC by Caramazza =-d his colleagues (Caramazza et el, 1977) as well as research chat I have dune (Ehrllch, 1980), has demuns~rated that number/sender agreement really c=- fumcciun to constrain the choice of referent in a way Chat signiflcantly facilltaCes processing. Within an AI framework, there has been some very interesting work carried out by Sidner (1977) m~d Grosz (1977) thac seeks to identify the current topic of a Cex1: and co show Chat knowledge of the topic can considerably sillily pronoun resolutlon. null It is important that people are able co select appropriate referents for pronouns and co have some basis for that decision. The research discussed so far has mentioned some of the factors Chac contribute co chose decisiuns. However, part of ~he problem of really understanding how people resolve pronouns is knowing how Certainly it is important a~d useful to polnc to a particular factor as concributlng to a reference decision, but in many texts more than one of these factors will be available to a reader or listener. One problem for the theorist is then to explaln which factor predominates in the decision as well as to describe the scheduling of evaluaclon procedures. If it could be shown that there was a stricc ordering in which tests were applied, say, number/gender agreement followed by selectionai restrictions followed by inference procedures, pronoun resoluclon may be simpler to explain. At our present level of knowledge it is dlfficulc to discern ordering principles chat have any degree of generality. For Instance, for every example where the topic seems to determine choice, a sinLilar example c~- often be found where the more recent antecedent is preferred over the one that forms part of the topic. Moreover, even this claim begs the quesclon of how the coplc can be identified unambiguously.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> A different approach is possible. The process of assigning a referent Co a pronoun c~m be viewed as utilizing two kinds of strategies. One strategy is concerned with selecting the best referent from amongst the candidates available. The ocher strategy is concerned with searching through memory for the candidates.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> These two types of strategy, which will be referred to msemC/-lically as inference and search strategies, have different kinds of characteristics. A search strategy dictates the order in which candldaces are evaluated, but has no machinery for carrying out the evaluation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> The inference strategy helps to set up the representaclon of the information in the cexC agains c which candldacas can be evaluated, but has ~o way of finding the c~aldidates. ~n the rest of this paper, she way these straCegles ~ighc interact will be explored and the results of two studies will be reported that bear on  the issues.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> One possible search strategy is ~o examine candidates serially beginning with the one menKioned most recently and working back through the text. This strategy makes some sense because, as Hobbs (1978) has pointed out, most pronouns co-refer with antecedents Chat were menr.laned within the last few senuences.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="7"> Thus, a serial search s~rategy provides a principled way of rescric~Lng how a text is searched. Moreover, there is some evidence fro~ psychological research ~hat it takes longer to resolve pronouns when the antecedent wlch which the pronotn~ co-refers is far rather than near the pronoun (e.g. Clark &amp; $engul, 1979; SprlnEston, 1975). Although such distance effects have been used to argue for differences in memory reErieval, wlCh the nearer antecedents bein 8 easier to retrieve Ch~ the further ones, none of the reported data rule out a serial search strategy.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="8"> AS argued earlier, a search s~rar~Ey alone cannot aecoun~ for pronoun resoluLian because it lacks any machinery for evaluation. There are, however, many kinds of informa~io~ tha~ people ~ bring to bear when evaluating c~dida~es and some of these were discussed earlier. A c~on method is to decide between aldernative candidates on ~he basis of information gained through inferences. Inference is a rather u~iqui~ous and often ill-deflned no~ion, and, although it is beyond the scope of this paper to clarify the concept, it is worth no~ing ~hat Chore are (at leas~) ~wo kinds of inference chat play a role in anaphora generally. One kind which T will call 'lexlcal' inferences are. drawn to establish Chat t~o different linguls~ic expressions refer ~o ~he same entity. For insnance, in the following pair of sentences from Garrod and Sanford (1977): (I) A bus came roaring round the corner The vehicle nearly flattened a pedes~rlan a 'lexlcal' inference esuabllshes that ~he particular vehicle mentluned in ~he second sentence is in fact a bus. Tnferences can also be drawn to support the selection of one referent over another. In a sentence such as : (2) John sold a car to Fred because he needed it a series of inferences based in part an out knowledge of selling a~d needing, supports ~he selection of Fred rather ~h=m John as referent for the pronoun &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;. In the experiments to be reported, it was 'lexical' inferences ra~her ~han the oCher kind that were manipulated. null Subjects in ~he experiment were asked to read texts such as the a~e given below: (3) Fred was outside all day John was inside all day a) He had a sleep inside after lunch b) He had a sleep in his room after lunch and then immedla~ely after, answer a question such as '~dho had a sleep after lunchY&amp;quot; Chat was designed to elicit the referent of the pranou~ in ~he las~ sentence. Two factors were independently varied. The antecedent could be near or far from the pronoun, ~he lacier affected by switching the order of the first PSwo sen~ences. The second factor was whether a 'bridg~Ing' inference had to be drw~n ~o es~chllsh co-reference bed, sen part of the predlca~e of the lasc sentence and ~he target sentence. The ~o versions, (a) no inference and (b) inference, are shown as alternative ~hird sencanoes in example (3) -hove. The principal measures were ~he Lime to answer ~he question and ~he accuracy of ~he respunse.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="9"> The experi-~ent addresses ~wo critical issues. One is whether ~he 'lewical' inference is drEdn as part of the evaluaLion procedure, or, whether it is drawn independently of Cha~ process. The o~her issue concerns the search sura~eEy itself: do subjects examine candlda~es serially, and, if so, do they s~ill use oCher criteria to reject the first canal/dace and choose the second? Two dlstincc models of processing can be cons~rucced from a conslderarion of Chess issues. In the case where inferences are triggered by the need ~o</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="11"> evaluate a candidate, any effect due to extra processing should be unaffected by whether the antecedent ks near or far from the pronoun. In either case the inference will be drawn in response to r/Re need to decide on the acceptability of the candidate. In the second model, the inference is triggered by the anaphoric expression, e.g. &amp;quot;in his room&amp;quot; An the third sentence, and the need to relate chat expression to the location &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; mentioned in a previous sentence. The inference is expected to take a certain amotmt of time to be drawn (cf. Kintsch, 1974). According to the second model, one would expect that in cases where the antecedent is near the pronoun, there will be some effect due to inference because the process may not be completed in time to answer the question. When the antecedent is far from the pronoun, however, the inference process will be completed and hence no effect of inference should still be detected. The two models assume rationality on the part of the subjects; that is, they assume that subjects will accurately select the further antecedent where appropriate even though recency would predict selecr.lon of the first candidate that is evaluated. If this assumption ks valid, subjects should select the far antecedent where appropriate mere often than the (erroneous) near candidate.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="12"> The results of the experiment, shown An Table 1, support the second model; ' lexlcal' inferences are drawn only once and in response to an anaphoric expression. The data also provide evidence of a serial search strategy by showing that there are more errors and longer latencles associated with far rather than near antecedents. The data further show that even when the correct choice is far from the pronoun, subjects will choose it in preference to ~he nearer condidate, thus demonstrating that a serial search strategy alone cannot predict the choice of referent.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="13"> The inferences that subjects had to draw in this experiment concerned simple lexlcal relations. The increase in latency due to having drawn such an inference supports the resul~s of earlier studies, partlcularly those of Garrod and Sanford (1977). Whac the present study fails to do, however, is to determine whether that inference ks drawn spontaneously, while reading. Previous research (e.g., ~intsch, 1974, Garrod ald Sanford, 1977) has shown ~hat inferences are more likely to be drawn while reading ~han at a response stage. It was thus of some interest to know when ~he lexical inferences in ~he present study were drawn.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="14"> This issue was examined by modifying the previous experiment to include both an additional measure of reading time and a 1.5s delay between presentation and test. The latter modification is important since if subjects are drawing inferences while reading, ~he process may not be completed by the time the question is asked i~mnedlately after presentation. The introduction of a delay also allows for a further test of the two proceasing modeled outlined earlier. If indeed 'lexlcal' inferences are drawn to establish co-reference between anaphoric expressions rather than to determine pronominal reference, as the previous experiment indicated, then there should be an effect of inference on reading ~ime but not at response when there is a delay, because by response ~he inference should have been dr~m. The data were consistent with this hypothesis. However, what also emerged from the second study was that only some of ~he passages seemed to elicit inferences at reading; the number of passages was increased in the second experiment ro corn%tar possible repetition effects. In fact, for half the passages subjects responded by saying there was no answer. An example of such a passage is given below: (4) Jill had a newspaper in the living-room Ann had a book in the living-room She read some chemistry An the evening It was also the case for these passages that the inferences did not seem to be drawn while reading but rather in response to the question. There is some doubt here about cause and effect, nevertheless, the  observation raises some in~eresclng questions concerning wha~ triggers an inference to be drawn. One answer, supplied by Garrod &amp; Sanford in ~heir experiment.s, is thac a relation baleen e~cpressioas muse someh~ be perceived before an inference is drawn to  found ~ha~ subjects would infer co-reference between &amp;quot;bus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot; in exa~le (i), they failed to make that connection, qui~ rightly, in a slnuLlar passage shown below: (5) A bus came roaring round the corner It nearly smashed some vehicles What kinds of strategies do readers adop~ when they search ~heir memory to find plausible referents for pronouns? Resul~s of che experiments reported here point ~o a strategy in which an~ities are examined serially from ~he pronoun. The purpose of a serial search strategy is to provide a principled we7 in which readers can ex&amp;quot;rn'Ine ~ho~e entities they have stored in mmory, for ~heir appropriateness as ~he referent of a particular prono ~-~. The strategy is ~hus unnecessary when there is only one emr/~y in memory by vlr~ue of sim~le criteria such as humor and gender agreement wi~h ~he pronoun. What cons~.Itutes 'simple' criteria is, of course, an open question; che answer, however, will materially affect ~he applicability of ~he search s~rategy.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="15"> The ~t important part of reference resolution is, however, deciding on the referent. A serial search strategy has no machinery for evaluating candidates, i~ can only direct ~he order in which candidates are examined. The process of selecting a plausible referent depends on ~he inferences a reader has drawn while ~he ~ext is read. Thus, when subjects found i~ hard ~o selec~ a referent at all ~hey also failed to draw m~my inferences while ~hey read ~he ~ext. Moreover, because ~he inferences for ~hese passa8es did seem to be drawn in response to a question ellci~Ing ~he referent, ~he i,~llcarAon is that inferences for che clearer material are generally drawn spontaneously and before a specific need for ~he informar.lon arises. One can conjecture from ~hese data that the select_ion of plausible referan~s is dependent on how well a reader has understood ~he preceding text. If inferences are not drawn on~il a specific need arises, such as finding a referent, ~hen it may be too late, to selec~ a referent easily or accurately, l~us, reference can also be viewed in terms of what a ~ext makes available for anaphoric reference (cf. Webber, 1978).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="16"> The picture of pronoun resolution that emerges from the studies reported here, is one in which effects of distance between the pronoun and its antecedent may play some role, not as a predicator of pronominal reference as has often been ~houEht, but as part of a search strateEy. There certainly are cases where nearer antecedents seem to be preferred over ones further back in the text; however, it is more profitable to look ~o concepts such as foregroundin E (of. Chafe, 1974) rather than silnple recency for explanations of the preference. * It is also of some interest to have shown that inferences ~my con~rlbute ~o pronoun resolution huc drawn for other reasons.</Paragraph>
