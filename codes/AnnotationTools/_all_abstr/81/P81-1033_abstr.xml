</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A flexible parser can deal with input that deviates from its grammar, in addition to input that conforms to it. Ideally, such a parser will correct the deviant input: sometimes, it will be unable to correct it at all; at other times, correction will be possible, but only to within a range of ambiguous possJbilities. This paper is concerned with such ambiguous situations, and with making it as easy as possible for the ambiguity to be resolved through consultation with the user of the parser - we presume interactive use. We show the importance of asking the user for clarification in as focused a way as possible.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Focused interaction of this kind is facilitated by a construction.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> specific approach to flexible parsing, with specialized parsing techniques for each type of construction, and specialized ambiguity representations for each type of ambiguity that a particular construction can give rise to. A construction-specific approach also aids in task-specific language development by allowing a language definibon that is natural in terms of the task domain to be interpreted directly without compilation into a uniform grammar formalism, thus greatly speeding the testing of changes to the language definition.</Paragraph>
