Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Many theories of semantic interpretation use A-term manipulation to compositionally compute the meaning of a sentence. These theories are usually implemented in a language such as Prolog that can simulate A-term operations with first-order unification. However, for some interesting cases, such as a Combinatory Categorial Grammar account of coordination constructs, this can only be done by obscuring the underlying linguistic theory with the &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; needed for implementation. This paper shows how the use of abstract syntax permitted by higher-order logic programming allows an elegant implementation of the semantics of Combinatory Categorial Grammar, including its handling of coordination constructs.</Paragraph>
