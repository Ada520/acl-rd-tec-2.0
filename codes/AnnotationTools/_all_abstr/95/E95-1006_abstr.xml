Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper defines a language Z~ for specifying LFG grammars. This enables constraints on LFG's composite ontology (c-structures synchronised with fstructures) to be stated directly; no appeal to the LFG construction algorithm is needed. We use f to specify schemata annotated rules and the LFG uniqueness, completeness and coherence principles. Broader issues raised by this work are noted and discussed.</Paragraph>
