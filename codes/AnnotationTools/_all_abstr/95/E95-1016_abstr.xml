Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present some variations affecting the association measure and thresholding on a technique for learning Selectional Restrictions from on-line corpora. It uses a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a statistical measure to generalize the appropriate semantic classes. Evaluation measures for the Selectional Restrictions learning task are discussed. Finally, an experimental evaluation of these variations is reported.</Paragraph>
