Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A variety of statistical methods for noun compound anMysis are implemented and compared. The results support two main conclusions. First, the use of conceptual association not only enables a broad coverage, but also improves the accuracy. Second, an analysis model based on dependency grammar is substantially more accurate than one based on deepest constituents, even though the latter is more prevalent in the literature.</Paragraph>
