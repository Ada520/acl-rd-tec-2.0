Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present some novel applications of Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) technique to parsing Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining grammars. The novel aspects are (a) immediate generalization of parses in the training set, (b) generalization over recursive structures and (c) representation of generalized parses as Finite State Transducers. A highly impoverished parser called a &amp;quot;stapler&amp;quot; has also been introduced. We present experimental results using EBL for different corpora and architectures to show the effectiveness of our approach. null</Paragraph>
