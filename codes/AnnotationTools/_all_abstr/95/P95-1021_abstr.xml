Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> DTG are designed to share some of the advantages of TAG while overcoming some of its limitations. DTG involve two composition operations called subsertion and sister-adjunction. The most distinctive feature of DTG is that, unlike TAG, there is complete uniformity in the way that the two DTG operations relate lexical items: subsertion always corresponds to complementation and sister-adjunction to modification. Furthermore, DTG, unlike TAG, can provide a uniform analysis for wh-movement in English and Kashmiri, despite the fact that the wh element in Kashmiri appears in sentence-second position, and not sentence-initial position as in English. null</Paragraph>
