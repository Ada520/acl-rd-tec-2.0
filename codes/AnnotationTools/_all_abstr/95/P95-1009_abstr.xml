Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A common feature of recent unification-based grammar formalisms is that they give the user the ability to define his own structures. However, this possibility is mostly limited and does not include non-monotonic operations. In this paper we show how nonmonotonic operations can also be user-defined by applying default logic (Reiter, 1980) and generalizing previous results on nonmonotonic sorts (Young and Rounds, 1993).</Paragraph>
