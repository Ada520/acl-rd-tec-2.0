Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Multiset-CCG is a combinatory categorial formalism that can capture the syntax and interpretation of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order in languages such as Turkish. The formalism compositionally derives the predicate-argument structure and the information structure (e.g. topic, focus) of a sentence, and uniformly handles word order variation among arguments and adjuncts within a clause, as well as in complex clauses and across clause boundaries.</Paragraph>
