Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We provide a constraint based computational model of linear precedence as employed in the HPSG grammar formalism. An extended feature logic which adds a wide range of constraints involving precedence is described. A sound, complete and terminating deterministic constraint solving procedure is given.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Deterministic computational model is achieved by weakening the logic such that it is sufficient for linguistic applications involving word-order.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Subject areas: feature logic, constraint based grammars</Paragraph>
