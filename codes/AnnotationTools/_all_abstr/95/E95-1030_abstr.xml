Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to locate syntactic constituents of natural language. This paper describes a fully automated hybrid system, using neural nets operating within a grammatic framework. It addresses the representation of language for connectionist processing, and describes methods of constraining the problem size. The function of the network is briefly explained, and results are given.</Paragraph>
