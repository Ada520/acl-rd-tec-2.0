Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper describes a substitutional approach to ellipsis resolution giving comparable results to (Dalrymple et al., 1991), but without the need for order-sensitive interleaving of quantifier scoping and ellipsis resolution. It is argued that the order-independence results from viewing semantic interpretation as building a description of a semantic composition, instead of the more common view of interpretation as actually performing the composition.</Paragraph>
