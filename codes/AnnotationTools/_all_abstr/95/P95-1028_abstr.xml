Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Traditional approaches to quantifier scope typically need stipulation to exclude readings that are unavailable to human understanders. This paper shows that quantifier scope phenomena can be precisely characterized by a semantic representation constrained by surhce constituency, if the distinction between referential and quantificational NPs is properly observed. A CCG implementation is described and compared to other approaches.</Paragraph>
