Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We extract from sentences a superstructure made of argumentative operators and connectives applying to the remaining set of terminal sub-sentences. We found the argumentative interpretation of utterances on a semantics defined at the linguistic level. We describe the computation of this particular semantics, based on the constraints that the superstructure impels to the argumentative power of terminal subsentences. null</Paragraph>
