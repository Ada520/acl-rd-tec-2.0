Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we provide a probabilistic interpretation for typed feature structures very similar to those used by Pollard and Sag. We begin with a version of the interpretation which lacks a treatment of re-entrant feature structures, then provide an extended interpretation which allows them. We sketch algorithms allowing the numerical parameters of our probabilistic interpretations of HPSG to be estimated from corpora.</Paragraph>
