Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The lexicalist approach to Machine Translation offers significant advantages in the development of linguistic descriptions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> However, the Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of (Whitelock, 1992) is NPcomplete. We present a polynomial time algorithm for lexicalist MT generation provided that sufficient information can be transferred to ensure more determinism.</Paragraph>
