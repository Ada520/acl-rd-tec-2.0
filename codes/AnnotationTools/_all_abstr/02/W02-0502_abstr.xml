Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We apply default inheritance hierarchies to generating the morphology of Hebrew verbs. Instead of lexically listing each of a word form's various parts, this strategy represents inflectional exponents as markings associated with the application of rules by which complex word forms are deduced from simpler roots or stems.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The high degree of similarity among verbs of different binyanim allows us to formulate general rules; these general rules are, however, sometimes overridden by binyan-specific rules. Similarly, a verb's form within a particular binyan is determined both by default rules and by overriding rules specific to individual verbs. Our result is a concise set of rules defining the morphology of all strong verbs in all binyanim. We express these rules in KATR, both a formalism for default inheritance hierarchies and associated software for computing the forms specified by those rules. As we describe the rules, we point out general strategies for expressing morphology in KATR and we discuss KATR's advantages over ordinary DATR for the representation of morphological systems.</Paragraph>
