</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present Minimum Bayes-Risk word alignment for machine translation. This statistical, model-based approach attempts to minimize the expected risk of alignment errors under loss functions that measure alignment quality. We describe various loss functions, including some that incorporate linguistic analysis as can be obtained from parse trees, and show that these approaches can improve alignments of the English-French Hansards.</Paragraph>
