<Paragraph position="0"> In the eld of empirical natural language processing, researchers constantly deal with large amounts of marked-up data; whether the markup is done by the researcher or someone else, human nature dictates that it will have errors in it.

The discussion is illustrated with speci c examples involving function tagging in the Penn treebank.</Paragraph>
