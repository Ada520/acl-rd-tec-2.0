Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a maximum entropy-based named entity recognizer (NER). It differs from previous machine learning-based NERs in that it uses information from the whole document to classify each word, with just one classifier. Previous work that involves the gathering of information from the whole document often uses a secondary classifier, which corrects the mistakes of a primary sentence-based classifier. In this paper, we show that the maximum entropy framework is able to make use of global information directly, and achieves performance that is comparable to the best previous machine learning-based NERs on MUC-6 and MUC-7 test data.</Paragraph>
