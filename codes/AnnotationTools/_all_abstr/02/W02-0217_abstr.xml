<Paragraph position="0"> We show how Bayesian networks and related probabilistic methods provide an efficient way of capturing the complex balancing of different factors that determine interpretation and generation in dialogue.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> As a case study, we show how a probabilistic approach can be used to model anaphora resolution in dialogue1.</Paragraph>
