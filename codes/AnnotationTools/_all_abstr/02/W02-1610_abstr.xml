Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe the design of an MT system that employs transfer rules induced from parsed bitexts and present evaluation results. The system learns lexico-structural transfer rules using syntactic pattern matching, statistical co-occurrence and error-driven filtering. In an experiment with domain-specific Korean to English translation, the approach yielded substantial improvements over three base-line systems.</Paragraph>
