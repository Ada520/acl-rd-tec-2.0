Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We treat nouns that behave adjectively, which we call adjectival nouns, extracted from large corpora.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> For example, in &amp;quot;financial world&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;world of finance,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;financial&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;finance&amp;quot; are different parts of speech, but their semantic behaviors are similar to each other. We investigate how adjectival nouns are similar to adjectives and different from non-adjectival nouns by using self-organizing semantic maps. We create five kinds of semantic maps, i.e., semantic maps of abstract nouns organized via (1) adjectives, (2) adjectival nouns, (3) non-adjectival nouns and (4) adjectival and adjectival nouns and a semantic map of adjectives, adjectival nouns and non-adjectival nouns organized via collocated abstract nouns, and compare them with each other to find similarities and differences.</Paragraph>
