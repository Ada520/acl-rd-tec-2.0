</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new framework for rapid development of mixed-initiative dialog systems. Using this framework, a developer can author sophisticated dialog systems for multiple channels of interaction by specifying an interaction modality, a rich task hierarchy and task parameters, and domain-specific modules. The framework includes a dialog history that tracks input, output, and results. We present the framework and preliminary results in two application domains.</Paragraph>
