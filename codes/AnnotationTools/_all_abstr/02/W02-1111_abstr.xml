Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The WordNet lexical ontology, which is primarily composed of common nouns, has been widely used in retrieval tasks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Here, we explore the notion of a fine-grained proper noun ontology and argue for the utility of such an ontology in retrieval tasks. To support this claim, we build a fine-grained proper noun ontology from unrestricted news text and use this ontology to improve performance on a question answering task.</Paragraph>
