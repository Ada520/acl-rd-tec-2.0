Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper examines different possibilities to take advantage of the taxonomic organization of a thesaurus to improve the accuracy of classifying new words into its classes. The results of the study demonstrate that taxonomic similarity between nearest neighbors, in addition to their distributional similarity to the new word, may be useful evidence on which classification decision can be based.</Paragraph>
