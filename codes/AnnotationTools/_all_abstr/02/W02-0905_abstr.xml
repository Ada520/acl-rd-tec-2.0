Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Natural language parsing requires extensive lexicons containing subcategorisation information for specific sublanguages. This paper describes an unsupervised method for acquiring both syntactic and semantic subcategorisation restrictions from corpora. Special attention will be paid to the role of co-composition in the acquisition strategy. The acquired information is used for lexicon tuning and parsing improvement.</Paragraph>
