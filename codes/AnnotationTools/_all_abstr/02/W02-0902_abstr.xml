Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents work on the task of constructing a word-level translation lexicon purely from unrelated mono-lingual corpora. We combine various clues such as cognates, similar context, preservation of word similarity, and word frequency. Experimental results for the construction of a German-English noun lexicon are reported. Noun translation accuracy of 39% scored against a parallel test corpus could be achieved.</Paragraph>
