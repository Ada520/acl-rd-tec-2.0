Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We explain dialogue management techniques for collaborative activities with humans, involving multiple concurrent tasks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Conversational context for multiple concurrent activities is represented using a &amp;quot;Dialogue Move Tree&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;Activity Tree&amp;quot; which support multiple interleaved threads of dialogue about different activities and their execution status. We also describe the incremental message selection, aggregation, and generation method employed in the system.</Paragraph>
