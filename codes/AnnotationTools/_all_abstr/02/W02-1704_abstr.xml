Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe our ongoing work on an application of XML/XSL technology to a dictionary, from whose source representation various views for the human reader as well as for automatic text generation and understanding are derived. Our case study is a dictionary of discourse markers, the words (often, but not always, conjunctions) that signal the presence of a disocurse relation between adjacent spans of text.</Paragraph>
