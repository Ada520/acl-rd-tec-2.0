Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper describes the application of k-Means, a standard clustering technique, to the task of inducing semantic classes for German verbs. Using probability distributions over verb subcategorisation frames, we obtained an intuitively plausible clustering of 57 verbs into 14 classes. The automatic clustering was evaluated against independently motivated, hand-constructed semantic verb classes. A series of post-hoc cluster analyses explored the influence of specific frames and frame groups on the coherence of the verb classes, and supported the tight connection between the syntactic behaviour of the verbs and their lexical meaning components. null</Paragraph>
