Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Traditional indexing methods often record physical positions for the specified words, thus fail to recognize context information. We suggest that Chinese text index should work on the layer of sentences. This paper presents an indexing method based on sentences and demonstrates how to use this method to help compute the mutual information of word pairs in a running text. It brings many conveniences to work of natural language processing.</Paragraph>
