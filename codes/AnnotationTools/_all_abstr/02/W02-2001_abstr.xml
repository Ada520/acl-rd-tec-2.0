Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a series of techniques for extracting English verb{particle constructions from raw text corpora. We initially propose three basic methods, based on tagger output, chunker output and a chunk grammar, respectively, with the chunk grammar method optionally combining with an attachment resolution module to determine the syntactic structure of verb{preposition pairs in ambiguous constructs. We then combine the three methods together into a single classifler, and add in a number of extra lexical and frequentistic features, producing a flnal F-score of 0.865 over the WSJ.</Paragraph>
