Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we show to what degree the countability of English nouns is predictable from their semantics. We found that at 78% of nouns' countability could be predicted using an ontology of 2,710 nodes. We also show how this predictability can be used to aid non-native speakers to determine the countability of English nouns when building a bilingual machine translation lexicon.</Paragraph>
