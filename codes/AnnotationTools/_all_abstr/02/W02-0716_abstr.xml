Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> General characteristics of a pragmatic metric for the production evaluation of speech-to-speech translations are discussed. While these characteristics constrain the space of allowable metrics, infinite definition space remains from which to select and define any particular metric. The recommended characteistics are drawn from the author's experience as primary developer of a text-based translation quality metric used in a production environment. The primary contribution is that of strict category ordering and two meta-rules that reduce the variance in assignment of errors to categories.</Paragraph>
