Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A machine translation model has been proposed where an input is translated through both source-language and target-language paraphrasing processes. We have implemented our prototype model for the Japanese-Chinese language pair. This paper describes our core idea of translation, where a source language paraphraser and a language transfer cooperates in translation by exchanging information about the source input.</Paragraph>
