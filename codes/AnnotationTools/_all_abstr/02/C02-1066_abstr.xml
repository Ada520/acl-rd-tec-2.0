<Paragraph position="0"> Uni cation grammars are known to be Turingequivalent; given a grammar a0 and a word a1 , it is undecidable whether a1a3a2a5a4a7a6 a0a9a8 . In order to ensure decidability, several constraints on grammars, commonly known as off-line parsability (OLP) were suggested. The recognition problem is decidable for grammars which satisfy OLP. An open question is whether it is decidable if a given grammar satis es OLP. In this paper we investigate various de nitions of OLP, discuss their inter-relations and show that some of them are undecidable.</Paragraph>
