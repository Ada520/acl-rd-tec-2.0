Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An unsupervised method for word sense disambiguation using a bilingual comparable corpus was developed. First, it extracts statistically significant pairs of related words from the corpus of each language. Then, aligning pairs of related words translingually, it calculates the correlation between the senses of a first-language polysemous word and the words related to the polysemous word, which can be regarded as clues for determining the most suitable sense. Finally, for each instance of the polysemous word, it selects the sense that maximizes the score, i.e., the sum of the correlations between each sense and the clues appearing in the context of the instance. To overcome both the problem of ambiguity in the translingual alignment of pairs of related words and that of disparity of topical coverage between corpora of different languages, an algorithm for calculating the correlation between senses and clues iteratively was devised.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> An experiment using Wall Street Journal and Nihon Keizai Shimbun corpora showed that the new method has promising performance; namely, the applicability and precision of its sense selection are 88.5% and 77.7%, respectively, averaged over 60 test polysemous words.</Paragraph>
