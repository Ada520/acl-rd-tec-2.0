<Paragraph position="0"> Why do few working spoken dialogue systems make use of dialogue models in their dialogue management? We find out the causes and propose a generic dialogue model. It promises to bridge the gap between practical dialogue management and (pattern-based) dialogue model through integrating interaction patterns with the underling tasks and modeling interaction patterns via utterance groups using a high level construct different from dialogue act.</Paragraph>
