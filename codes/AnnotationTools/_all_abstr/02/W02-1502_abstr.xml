Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The grammar matrix is an open-source starter-kit for the development of broad-coverage HPSGs. By using a type hierarchy to represent cross-linguistic generalizations and providing compatibility with other open-source tools for grammar engineering, evaluation, parsing and generation, it facilitates not only quick start-up but also rapid growth towards the wide coverage necessary for robust natural language processing and the precision parses and semantic representations necessary for natural language understanding. null</Paragraph>
