Open Mind Word Expert is an imple-

<Paragraph position="0"> mented active learning system for collecting word sense tagging from the general public over the Web. It is available at http://teach-computers.org. We expect the system to yield a large volume of high-quality training data at a much lower cost than the traditional method of hiring lexicographers. We thus propose a Senseval-3 lexical sample activity where the training data is collected via Open Mind Word Expert.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> If successful, the collection process can be extended to create the definitive corpus of word sense information.</Paragraph>
