Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose that machine translation (MT) is a useful application for evaluating and deriving the development of NL components, especially in a wide-coverage analysis system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Given the architecture of our MT system, which is a transfer system based on linguistic modules, correct analysis is expected to be a prerequisite for correct translation, suggesting a correlation between the two, given relatively mature transfer and generation components.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We show through error analysis that there is indeed a strong correlation between the quality of the translated output and the subjectively determined goodness of the analysis. We use this correlation as a guide for development of a coordinated parallel analysis effort in 7 languages.</Paragraph>
