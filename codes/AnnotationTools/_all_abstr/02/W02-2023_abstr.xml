Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The regularity of named entities is used to learn names and to extract named entities. Having only a few name elements and a set of patterns the a l gorithm learns new names and its elements. A verification step assures quality using a large background corpus. Further improvement is reached through classifying the newly learnt elements on character level. Moreover, unsupe r vised rule learning is discussed.</Paragraph>
