Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Parsli is a finite-state (FS) parser which can be tailored to the lexicon, syntax, and semantics of a particular application using a hand-editable declarative lexicon. The lexicon is defined in terms of a lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar, which is subsequently mapped to a FS representation. This approach gives the application designer better and easier control over the natural language understanding component than using an off-the-shelf parser. We present results using Parsli on an application that creates 3D-images from typed input.</Paragraph>
