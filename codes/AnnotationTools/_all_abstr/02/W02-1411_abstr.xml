Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Automatic acquisition of paraphrase knowledge for content words is proposed. Using only a non-parallel text corpus, we compute the paraphrasability metrics between two words from their similarity in context. We then filter words such as proper nouns from external knowledge.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Finally, we use a heuristic in further filtering to improve the accuracy of the automatic acquisition. In this paper, we report the results of acquisition experiments.</Paragraph>
