Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In order to answer factoid questions, the Webclopedia QA system employs a range of knowledge resources. These include a QA Typology with answer patterns, WordNet, information about typical numerical answer ranges, and semantic relations identified by a robust parser, to filter out likely-looking but wrong candidate answers. This paper describes the knowledge resources and their impact on system performance.</Paragraph>
