This paper  investigateswaystoautomaticallyextractquestionterminologyfromacorpusofquestionsand null represent them for the purposeof classifyingby question type. Ourkeyinterestistoseewhether or not semantic features can enhance the representation of strongly lexical nature of question sentences. We compare two feature sets: one with lexical features only, and another with a mixture of lexical and semantic features. For evaluation, we measure the classication accuracy made bytwomachine learning algorithms, C5.0 and PEBLS, by using a procedure called domain cross-validation, which eectively measures the domain transferability of features.</Paragraph>
