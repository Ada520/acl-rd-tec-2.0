<Paragraph position="0"> Our approach to multilingual named entity (NE) recognition in the context of the CoNLL Shared Task consists of the following ingredients: Feature engineering A human expert (though not necessarily a language expert) determines relevant features to be used to determine whether or not a word is part of a named entity.</Paragraph>
