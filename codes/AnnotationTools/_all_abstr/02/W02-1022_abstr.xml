Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An important component of any generation system is the mapping dictionary, a lexicon  ofelementarysemanticexpressionsandcorresponding natural language realizations. Typically, labor-intensive knowledge-based methods are used to construct the dictionary. We instead propose to acquire it automatically via a novel multiple-pass algorithm employing multiple-sequence alignment, a technique commonly used in bioinformatics. Crucially, our method leverages latent information contained in multi-parallel corpora  |datasets that supply several verbalizations of the corresponding semantics rather than just one.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We used our techniques to generate natural language versions of computer-generated mathematical proofs, with good results on both a per-component and overall-output basis. For example, in evaluations involving a dozen human judges, our system produced output whose readability and faithfulnesstothesemanticinputrivaledthatof null a traditional generation system.</Paragraph>
