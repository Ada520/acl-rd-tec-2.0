Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Ambiguity is the fundamental property of natural language. Perhaps, the most burdensome case of ambiguity manifests itself on the syntactic level of analysis. In order to face up to the high number of obtained derivation trees, this paper describes several techniques for evaluation of the figures of merit, which define a sort order on parsing trees. The presented methods are based on language specific features of synthetical languages and they improve the results of simple stochastic approaches.</Paragraph>
