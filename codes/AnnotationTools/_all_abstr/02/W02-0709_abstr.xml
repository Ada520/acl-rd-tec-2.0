Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for the Chinese-to-English speech-to-speech (S2S) translation, which is interactive under the guidance of dialogue management. In this approach, the input utterance is first pre-processed and then serially translated by the template-based translator and the inter-lingua based translator. The dialogue management mechanism (DMM) is employed to supervise the interactive analysis for disambiguation of the input.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The interaction is led by the system, so the system always acts on its own initiative in the interactive procedure. In this approach, the complicated semantic analysis is not involved.</Paragraph>
