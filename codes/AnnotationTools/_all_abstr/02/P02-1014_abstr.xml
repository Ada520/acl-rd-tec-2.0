Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a noun phrase coreference system that extends the work of Soon et al. (2001) and, to our knowledge, produces the best results to date on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference resolution data sets -- F-measures of 70.4 and 63.4, respectively. Improvements arise from two sources: extra-linguistic changes to the learning framework and a large-scale expansion of the feature set to include more sophisticated linguistic knowledge.</Paragraph>
