<Paragraph position="0"> Most dialogue architectures are either pipelined or, if agent-based, are restricted to a pipelined owof-information. The TRIPS dialogue architecture is agent-based and asynchronous, with several layers of information ow. We present this architecture and the synchronization issues we encountered in building a truly distributed, agent-based dialogue architecture.</Paragraph>
