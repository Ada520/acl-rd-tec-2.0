Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe the architecture of the AskMSR question answering system and systematically evaluate contributions of different system components to accuracy.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The system differs from most question answering systems in its dependency on data redundancy rather than sophisticated linguistic analyses of either questions or candidate answers. Because a wrong answer is often worse than no answer, we also explore strategies for predicting when the question answering system is likely to give an incorrect answer.</Paragraph>
