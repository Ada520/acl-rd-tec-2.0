Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The purpose of this study is to propose a new method for machine translation. Wehave proceeded through with two projects for report generation (Kittredge and Polguere, 2000) : Weather Forecast and Monthly Economic Report to be produced in four languages : English, Japanese, French, and German. Their input data is stored in XML-DB. We applied a three-stage pipelined architecture (Reiter and Dale, 2000), and each stage was implemented as XML transformation processes. Weregard XML stored data as language-neutral intermediate form and employ the so-called `sublanguage approach' (Somers, 2000). The machine translation process is implemented via XML-DB as a kind of interlingua approach instead of the conventional structure transfer approach.</Paragraph>
