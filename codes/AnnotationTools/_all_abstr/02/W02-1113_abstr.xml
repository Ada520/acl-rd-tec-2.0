Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a module dedicated to the elaboration of linguistic resources for a versatile Information Extraction system. In order to decrease the time spent on the elaboration of resources for the IE system and guide the end-user in a new domain, we suggest to use a machine learning system that helps defining new templates and associated resources. This knowledge is automatically derived from the text collection, in interaction with a large semantic network.</Paragraph>
