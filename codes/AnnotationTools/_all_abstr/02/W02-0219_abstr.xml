Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This document proposes a new taxonomy for describing the quality of services which are based on spoken dialogue systems (SDSs), and operated via a telephone interface. It is used to classify instrumentally or expert-derived dialogue and system measures, as well as quality features perceived by the user of the service.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A comparison is drawn to the quality of human-to-human telephone services, and implications for the development of evaluation frameworks such as PARADISE are discussed.</Paragraph>
