Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents the design of a text-entry device that requires only four buttons. Such a device is applicable as the text interface of portable machines and as an interface for disabled people. The text-entry system is predictive;; the basis for this is an adaptive language model. Our evaluation showed that the system is at least as ecient for the entry of free text as the text-entry systems of current-generation mobile phones. The system requires fewer keystrokes than a full keyboard. After adaptation, one user reached a maximum speed of 23 wpm.</Paragraph>
