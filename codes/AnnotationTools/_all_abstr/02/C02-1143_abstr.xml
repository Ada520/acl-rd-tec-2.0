Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we report on our experiments on automatic Word Sense Disambiguation using a maximum entropy approach for both English and Chinese verbs. We compare the difficulty of the sense-tagging tasks in the two languages and investigate the types of contextual features that are useful for each language. Our experimental results suggest that while richer linguistic features are useful for English WSD, they may not be as beneficial for Chinese. null</Paragraph>
