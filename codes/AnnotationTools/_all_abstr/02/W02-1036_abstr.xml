Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we propose a method for learning a classifier which combines outputs of more than one Japanese named entity extractors. The proposed combination method belongs to the family of stacked generalizers, which is in principle a technique of combining outputs of several classifiers at the first stage by learning a second stage classifier to combine those outputs at the first stage. Individual models to be combined are based on maximum entropy models, one of which always considers surrounding contexts of a fixed length, while the other considers those of variable lengths according to the number of constituent morphemes of named entities. As an algorithm for learning the second stage classifier, we employ a decision list learning method. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves improvement over the best known results with Japanese named entity extractors based on maximum entropy models.</Paragraph>
