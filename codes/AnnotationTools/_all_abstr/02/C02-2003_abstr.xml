Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Spoken queries are a natural medium for searching the Web in settings where typing on a keyboard is not practical. This paper describes a speech interface to the Google search engine. We present experiments with various statistical language models, concluding that a unigram model with collocations provides the best combination of broad coverage, predictive power, and real-time performance. We also report accuracy results of the prototype system. null</Paragraph>
