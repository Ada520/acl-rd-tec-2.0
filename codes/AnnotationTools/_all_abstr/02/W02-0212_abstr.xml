Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper deals with conditional responses of the form &amp;quot;Not if c/Yes if c&amp;quot; in reply to a question &amp;quot;?q&amp;quot; in the context of information-seeking dialogues. A conditional response is triggered if the obtainability of q depends on whether c holds: The response indicates a possible need to find alternative solutions, opening a negotiation in the dialogue. The paper discusses the conditions under which conditional responses are appropriate, and proposes a uniform approach to their generation and interpretation.</Paragraph>
