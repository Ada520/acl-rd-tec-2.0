Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A number of machine translation systemsbased on thelearningalgorithms are presented. These methods acquire translation rules from pairs of similar sentences in a bilingual text corpora. This means that it is difficult for the systems to acquire the translation rules from sparse data. As a result, these methods require large amounts of training data in order to acquire high-quality translation rules. To overcomethis problem, we propose a method ofmachine translation using a Recursive Chain-link-type Learning. In our new method, the system can acquire many new high-quality translation rules from sparse translation examples based on already acquired translation rules. Therefore, acquisition of new translation rules results in the generation of more new translation rules.</Paragraph>
