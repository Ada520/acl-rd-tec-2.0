Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we propose a classification of grammar development strategies according to two criteria : hand-written versus automatically acquired grammars, and grammars based on a low versus high level of syntactic abstraction. Our classification yields four types of grammars. For each type, we discuss implementation and evaluation issues.</Paragraph>
