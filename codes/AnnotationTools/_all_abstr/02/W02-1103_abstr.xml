Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we face the automatic construction of a lexical taxonomy for the Spanish language using as input a taxonomy of English (WordNet)1 and a set of bilingual (English/Spanish) resources.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Although applied to Spanish/English our method claims to be general enough to be applied in the cases a skeletal taxonomy already exists and we dispose of methods for mapping items to this taxonomy with known confidence scores.</Paragraph>
