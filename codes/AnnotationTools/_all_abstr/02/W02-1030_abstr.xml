Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper shows that the web can be employed to obtain frequencies for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus. We describe a method for retrieving counts for adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams from the web by querying a search engine. We evaluate this method by demonstrating that web frequencies and correlate with frequencies obtained from a carefully edited, balanced corpus.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We also perform a task-based evaluation, showing that web frequencies can reliably predict human plausibility judgments.</Paragraph>
