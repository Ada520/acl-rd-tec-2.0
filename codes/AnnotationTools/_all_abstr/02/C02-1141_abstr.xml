Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A standard architecture for an NLG system has been defined in (Reiter and Dale, 2000). Their work describes the modularization of an NLG system and the tasks of each module. However, they do not indicate what kind of tools can be used by each module. Nevertheless, we believe that certain tools widely used by the AI or NLU community are appropriate for NLG tasks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper presents a complete integrated NLG system which uses a Description logic for the content determination module, Segmented Discourse Representation Theory for the document structuring module and a lexicalized formalism for the tactical component. The NLG system, which takes into account a user model, is illustrated with a generator which produces texts explaining the steps taken by a proof assistant.</Paragraph>
