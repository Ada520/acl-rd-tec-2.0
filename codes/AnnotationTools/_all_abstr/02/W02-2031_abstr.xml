<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a learning method using multiple stacking for named entity recognition.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In order to take into account the tags of the surrounding words, we propose a method which employs stacked learners using the tags predicted by the lower level learners. We have applied this approach to the CoNLL-2002 shared task to improve a base system.</Paragraph>
