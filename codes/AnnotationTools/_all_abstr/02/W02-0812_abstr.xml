</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an evaluation of an ensemble-based system that participated in the English and Spanish lexical sample tasks of SENSEVAL-2. The system combines decision trees of unigrams, bigrams, and co-occurrences into a single classifier. The analysis is extended to include the SENSEVAL-1 data.</Paragraph>
