</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes LINGUA - an architecture for text processing in Bulgarian. First, the pre-processing modules for tokenisation, sentence splitting, paragraph segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, clause chunking and noun phrase extraction are outlined. Next, the paper proceeds to describe in more detail the anaphora resolution module. Evaluation results are reported for each processing task.</Paragraph>
