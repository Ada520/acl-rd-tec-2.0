Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a maximum entropy Word Sense Disambiguation system we developed which performs competitively on SENSEVAL-2 test data for English verbs. We demonstrate that using richer linguistic contextual features significantly improves tagging accuracy, and compare the system's performance with human annotator performance in light of both fine-grained and coarse-grained sense distinctions made by the sense inventory. null</Paragraph>
