Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a new Cornell University course serving as a nonprogramming introduction to computer science, with natural language processing and information retrieval forming a crucial part of the syllabus.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Material was drawn from a wide variety of topics (such as theories of discourse structure and random graph models of the World Wide Web) and presented at some technical depth, but was massaged to make it suitable for a freshman-level course. Student feed-back from the flrst running of the class was overall quite positive, and a grant from the GE Fund has been awarded to further support the course's development and goals.</Paragraph>
