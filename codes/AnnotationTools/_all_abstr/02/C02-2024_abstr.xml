Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes an indexing substrate for typed feature structures (ISTFS), which is an efficient retrieval engine for typed feature structures. Given a set of typed feature structures, the ISTFS efficiently retrieves its subset whose elements are unifiable or in a subsumption relation with a query feature structure. The efficiency of the ISTFS is achieved by calculating a unifiability checking table prior to retrieval and finding the best index paths dynamically. null</Paragraph>
