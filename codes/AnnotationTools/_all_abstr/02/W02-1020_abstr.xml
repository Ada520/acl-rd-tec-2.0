</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Text prediction is a form of interactive machine translation that is well suited to skilled translators. In principle it can assist in the production of a target text with minimal disruption to a translator's normal routine. However, recent evaluations of a prototype prediction system showed that it significantly decreased the productivity of most translators who used it. In this paper, we analyze the reasons for this and propose a solution which consists in seeking predictions that maximize the expected benefit to the translator, rather than just trying to anticipate some amount of upcoming text. Using a model of a &amp;quot;typical translator&amp;quot; constructed from data collected in the evaluations of the prediction prototype, we show that this approach has the potential to turn text prediction into a help rather than a hindrance to a translator.</Paragraph>
