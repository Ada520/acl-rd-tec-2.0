</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Current information extraction efforts in the biomedical domain tend to focus on finding entities and facts in structured databases or MEDLINE abstracts. We apply a gene and protein name tagger trained on Medline abstracts (ABGene) to a randomly selected set of full text journal articles in the biomedical domain. We show the effect of adaptations made in response to the greater heterogeneity of full text.</Paragraph>
