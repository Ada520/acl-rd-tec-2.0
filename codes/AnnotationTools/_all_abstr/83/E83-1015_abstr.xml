ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A new type of machine dictionary is described, which uses terminological relations to build up a semantic network representing the terms of a particular subject field, through interaction with the user. These relations are then used to dynamically generate outline definitions of terms in on-line query mode. The definitions produced are precise, consistent and informative, and allow the user to situate a query term in the local conceptual ~vironment. The simple definitions based on terminological relations are supplemented by information contained in facets and modifiers, which allow the user to capture different views of the data.</Paragraph>
