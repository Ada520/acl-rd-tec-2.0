EXPLORER (Lehnert and Sbwartz, 1982;
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Shwartz 1982) is a non-fragile, 'bands-on&amp;quot; language analysis system that allows oil explorationists with no knowledge of computers or computer progra-.-ing to create customized maps. Users in Tulsa, Denver, and New Orleans currently have dial-up access to a DEC-20 where EXPLORER is implemented in TLISP. A user converses with EXI~LORER about * desired map until both parties have agreed on an adequate and unambiguous set of specifications. Another phone link then carries EXPLORER's output to an IBM 3033 which runs database retrieval routines on co~aerciel well data. When all the information has been secured from well data, a graphics system takes over to perform the actual map generation. EXPLORER is currently undergoing evaluation, and it is targetted for a 1983 installation in all regional offices of a major oil company* for restricted use by geologists and geophysicists.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Since our intended user population is naive about computers, EXPLORER's interactive design is dominated by &amp;quot;user-friendly&amp;quot; features. EXPLORER processes information retrieval requests stated in English, without imposing vocabulary limitations or syntactic restrictions on the user. Using a 7000-word dictionary, EXPLORER makes inferences about what a user is saying and initiates interactive dialogues when m:p specifications are not adequate or potentially ambiguous.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> While &amp;quot;user-friendly&amp;quot; system designs often accomodate novice users at the expense of efficient interactions with expert users, EXPLORER naturally tunes itself to both novice and expert users. An expert can state a request very concisely, without a long interactive session, while a novice is guided by a question-and-answer dialogue. Since all users are expected to enter mispellings and typos, an intelligent spelling corrector enables the user to correct typographical errors quickly and easily.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> *A proprietary agreement forbids us from identifying them.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Once a request has been analyzed by EXPLORER, the user is given an opportunity to verify EXI~LORER*s understanding of that request or make changes as needed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> The following example will illustrate the complexity of the map requests that EXPLORER is designed to handle. Following the input, EXPLORER displays its interpretation of the request for verification by the user.</Paragraph>
