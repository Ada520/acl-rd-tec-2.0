<Paragraph position="0"> The task of understanding unedited naval ship-co-shore messages is implemented in the presence of a large database of domain specific knowledge. The program uses internal syntactic and semantic expectations to analyze the texts and co correct errors that arise during understanding, such as syntactic errors, missing punctuation, and errors of spelling and usage.
