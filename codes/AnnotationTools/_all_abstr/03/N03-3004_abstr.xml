Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an unsupervised method for discriminating among the senses of a given target word based on the context in which it occurs. Instances of a word that occur in similar contexts are grouped together via McQuitty's Similarity Analysis, an agglomerative clustering algorithm. The context in which a target word occurs is represented by surface lexical features such as unigrams, bigrams, and second order co-occurrences. This paper summarizes our approach, and describes the results of a preliminary evaluation we have carried out using data from the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample and the line corpus.</Paragraph>
