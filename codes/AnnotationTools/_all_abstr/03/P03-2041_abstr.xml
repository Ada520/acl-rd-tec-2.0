Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Often one may wish to learn a tree-to-tree mapping, training it on unaligned pairs of trees, or on a mixture of trees and strings.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Unlike previous statistical formalisms (limited to isomorphic trees), synchronous TSG allows local distortion of the tree topology. We reformulate it to permit dependency trees, and sketch EM/Viterbi algorithms for alignment, training, and decoding.</Paragraph>
