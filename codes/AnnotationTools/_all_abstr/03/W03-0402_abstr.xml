Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces a novel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based voting algorithm for reranking, which provides a way to solve the sequential models indirectly. We have presented a risk formulation under the PAC framework for this voting algorithm. We have applied this algorithm to the parse reranking problem, and achieved labeled recall and precision of 89.4%/89.8% on WSJ section 23 of Penn Treebank.</Paragraph>
