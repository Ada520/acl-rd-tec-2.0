Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Following the recent adoption by the machine translation community of automatic evaluation using the BLEU/NIST scoring process, we conduct an in-depth study of a similar idea for evaluating summaries. The results show that automatic evaluation using unigram co-occurrences between summary pairs correlates surprising well with human evaluations, based on various statistical metrics; while direct application of the BLEU evaluation procedure does not always give good results.</Paragraph>
