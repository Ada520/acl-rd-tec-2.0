Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We will demonstrate the latest version of an ongoing project to create an intelligent procedure assistant for use by astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). The system functionality includes spoken dialogue control of navigation, coordinated display of the procedure text, display of related pictures, alarms, and recording and playback of voice notes. The demo also exemplifies several interesting component technologies. Speech recognition and language understanding have been developed using the Open Source REGULUS 2 toolkit. This implements an approach to portable grammar-based language modelling in which all models are derived from a single linguistically motivated unification grammar. Domain-specific CFG language models are produced by first specialising the grammar using an automatic corpus-based method, and then compiling the resulting specialised grammars into CFG form. Translation between language centered and domain centered semantic representations is carried out by ALTERF, another Open Source toolkit, which combines rule-based and corpus-based processing in a transparent way.</Paragraph>
