Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a supervised machine learning algorithm for metonymy resolution, which exploits the similarity between examples of conventional metonymy. We show that syntactic head-modifier relations are a high precision feature for metonymy recognition but suffer from data sparseness. We partially overcome this problem by integrating a thesaurus and introducing simpler grammatical features, thereby preserving precision and increasing recall.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our algorithm generalises over two levels of contextual similarity. Resulting inferences exceed the complexity of inferences undertaken in word sense disambiguation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We also compare automatic and manual methods for syntactic feature extraction.</Paragraph>
