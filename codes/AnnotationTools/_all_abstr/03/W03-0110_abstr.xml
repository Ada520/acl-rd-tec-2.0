</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We define a data model for storing geographic information from multiple sources that enables the efficient production of customizable gazetteers. The GazDB separates names from features while storing the relationships between them. Geographic names are stored in a variety of resolutions to allow for i18n and for multiplicity of naming. Geographic features are categorized along several axes to facilitate selection and filtering.</Paragraph>
