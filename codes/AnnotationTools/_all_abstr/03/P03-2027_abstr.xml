Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a spoken dialog Q-A system as a substitution for call centers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The system is capable of making dialogs for both fixing speech recognition errors and for clarifying vague questions, based on only large text knowledge base. We introduce two measures to make dialogs for fixing recognition errors. An experimental evaluation shows the advantages of these measures.</Paragraph>
