Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe ontology-based text categorization in which the domain ontologies are automatically acquired through morphological rules and statistical methods. The ontology-based approach is a promising way for general information retrieval applications such as knowledge management or knowledge discovery. As a way to evaluate the quality of domain ontologies, we test our method through several experiments. Automatically acquired domain ontologies, with or without manual editing, have been used for text categorization. The results are quite satisfactory. Furthermore, we have developed an automatic method to evaluate the quality of our domain ontology.</Paragraph>
