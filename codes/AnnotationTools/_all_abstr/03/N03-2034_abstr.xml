Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We report on our work to automatically build a corpus of instructional text annotated with lexical semantics information. We have coupled the parser LCFLEX with a lexicon and ontology derived from two lexical resources, VerbNet for verbs and CoreLex for nouns. We discuss how we built our lexicon and ontology, and the parsing results we obtained.</Paragraph>
