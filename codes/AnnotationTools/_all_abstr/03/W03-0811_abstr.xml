</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Modern dialog and information systems are increasingly based on distributed component architectures to cope with all kinds of heterogeneity and to enable flexible re-use of existing software components. This contribution presents the MULTIPLATFORM testbed as a powerful framework for the development of integrated multimodal dialog systems. The paper provides a general overview of our approach and explicates its foundations. It describes advanced sample applications that have been realized using the integration platform and compares our approach to related works.</Paragraph>
