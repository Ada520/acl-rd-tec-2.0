Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes our ongoing research project on text simplification for congenitally deaf people. Text simplification we are aiming at is the task of offering a deaf reader a syntactic and lexical paraphrase of a given text for assisting her/him to understand what it means.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, we discuss the issues we should address to realize text simplification and report on the present results in three different aspects of this task: readability assessment, paraphrase representation and post-transfer error detection.</Paragraph>
