Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper addresses a very specific problem that happens to be common in health science research. We present a machine learning based method for identifying patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure and other related conditions by automatically classifying clinical notes. This method relies on a Perceptron neural network classifier trained on comparable amounts of positive and negative samples of clinical notes previously categorized by human experts. The documents are represented as feature vectors where features are a mix of single words and concept mappings to MeSH and HICDA ontologies. The method is designed and implemented to support a particular epidemiological study but has broader implications for clinical research. In this paper, we describe the method and present experimental classification results based on classification accuracy and positive predictive value.</Paragraph>
