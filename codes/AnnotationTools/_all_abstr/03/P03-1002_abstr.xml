Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a novel, customizable IE paradigm that takes advantage of predicate-argument structures. We also introduce a new way of automatically identifying predicate argument structures, which is central to our IE paradigm. It is based on: (1) an extended set of features; and (2) inductive decision tree learning.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The experimental results prove our claim that accurate predicate-argument structures enable high quality IE results.</Paragraph>
