Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The purpose of this study is to construct a semantic analysis method for disambiguating Japanese compound verbs. Japanese speakers produce a rich variety of compound verbs, making it difficult to process them by computer. We construct a method employing 110 disambiguation rules based on the semantic features of the first verb of a compound and syntactic patterns consisting of co-occurrence between verbs and nouns. The disambiguation rules are evaluated by applying them to compound verbs in the dictionary. The obtained accuracy is 87.19% for our rules. This result shows the advantage of our method.</Paragraph>
