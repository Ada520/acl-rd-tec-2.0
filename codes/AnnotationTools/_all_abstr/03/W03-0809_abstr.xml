Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper presents a system architecture for the automatic generation of interface specifications from ontologies.1 The ensuing interfaces (XML schema definitions) preserve a significant amount of the knowledge originally encoded in the ontology. The approach is relevant for the engineering of large-scale language technology systems. It has been successfully deployed in a complex multi-modal dialogue system SMARTKOM.</Paragraph>
