Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The approach to knowledge representation taken in a multi-modal multi-domain dialogue system - SMARTKOM - is presented. We focus on the ontological and representational issues and choices helping to construct an ontology, which is shared by multiple components of the system, can be re-used in different projects and applied to various tasks. Finally, examples highlighting the usefulness of our approach are given.</Paragraph>
