Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The question of whether metonymy carries across languages has always been interesting for language representation and processing. Until now attempts to answer this question have always been based on small-scale analyses. With the advent of EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998), a multilingual thesaurus covering eight languages and organized along the same lines as WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/) we have a unique opportunity to research this question on a large scale. In this paper we systematically explore sets of concepts comprising possible metonymic relations that have been identified in WordNet.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The sets of concepts are evaluated, and a contrastive analysis of their lexicalization patterns in English, Dutch and Spanish is performed. Our investigation gives insight into the cross-linguistic nature of metonymic polysemy and defines a methodology for dynamic extensions of semantic resources.</Paragraph>
