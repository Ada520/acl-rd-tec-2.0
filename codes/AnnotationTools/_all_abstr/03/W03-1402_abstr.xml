Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we address the issue of the encoding of information on metaphors in a WordNet-like database, i.e. the Italian wordnet in EuroWordNet (ItalWordNet).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> When analysing corpus data we find a huge number of metaphoric expressions which can be hardly dealt with by using as reference database ItalWordNet. In particular, we have compared information contained both in dictionaries of Italian and in ItalWordNet with actual uses of words found in a corpus. We thus put forward proposals to enrich a resource like ItalWordNet with relevant information. null</Paragraph>
