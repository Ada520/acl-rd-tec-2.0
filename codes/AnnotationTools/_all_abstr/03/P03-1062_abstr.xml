Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We train a decision tree inducer (CART) and a memory-based classifier (MBL) on predicting prosodic pitch accents and breaks in Dutch text, on the basis of shallow, easy-to-compute features. We train the algorithms on both tasks individually and on the two tasks simultaneously. The parameters of both algorithms and the selection of features are optimized per task with iterative deepening, an efficient wrapper procedure that uses progressive sampling of training data. Results show a consistent significant advantage of MBL over CART, and also indicate that task combination can be done at the cost of little generalization score loss. Tests on cross-validated data and on held-out data yield F-scores of MBL on accent placement of 84 and 87, respectively, and on breaks of 88 and 91, respectively. Accent placement is shown to outperform an informed baseline rule; reliably predicting breaks other than those already indicated by intra-sentential punctuation, however, appears to be more challenging.</Paragraph>
