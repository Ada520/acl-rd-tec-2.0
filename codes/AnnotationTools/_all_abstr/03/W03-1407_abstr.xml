Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper demonstrates that the polysemy of the verb grow is a result of natural extension of individual meanings connoted by its basic literal meaning and that the polysemy of grow, as such, can be disambiguated by applying simple rules of elimination to the argument structures, which are the contexts that make particular senses viable.</Paragraph>
