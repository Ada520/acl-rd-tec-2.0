Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Automatic text extraction techniques have proved robust, but very often their summaries are not coherent. In this paper, we propose a new extraction method which uses local coherence as a means to improve the overall quality of automatic summaries. Two algorithms for sentence selection are proposed and evaluated on scientific documents.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Evaluation showed that the method ameliorates the quality of summaries, noticeable improvements being obtained for longer summaries produced by an algorithm which selects sentences using an evolutionary algorithm.</Paragraph>
