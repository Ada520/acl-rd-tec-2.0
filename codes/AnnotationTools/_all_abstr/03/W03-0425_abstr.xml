Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a classifier-combination experimental framework for named entity recognition in which four diverse classifiers (robust linear classifier, maximum entropy, transformation-based learning, and hidden Markov model) are combined under different conditions. When no gazetteer or other additional training resources are used, the combined system attains a performance of 91.6F on the English development data; integrating name, location and person gazetteers, and named entity systems trained on additional, more general, data reduces the F-measure error by a factor of 15 to 21% on the English data.</Paragraph>
