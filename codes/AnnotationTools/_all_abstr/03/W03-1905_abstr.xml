Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe the overall model for MILE lexical entries and provide an instantiation of the model in RDF/OWL. This work has been done with an eye toward the goal of creating a web-based registry of lexical data categories and enabling the description of lexical information by establishing relations among them, and/or using pre-defined objects that may reside at various locations on the web. It is also assumed that using OWL specifications to enhance specifications of the ontology of lexical objects will eventually enable the exploitation of inferencing engines to retrieve and possibly create lexical information on the fly, as suited to particular contexts. As such, the model and RDF instantiation provided here are in line with the goals of ISO TC37 SC4, and should be fully mappable to the proposed pivot.</Paragraph>
