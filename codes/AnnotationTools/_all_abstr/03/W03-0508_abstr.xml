Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new approach to summary evaluation which combines two novel aspects, namely (a) content comparison between gold standard summary and system summary via factoids, a pseudo-semantic representation based on atomic information units which can be robustly marked in text, and (b) use of a gold standard consensus summary, in our case based on 50 individual summaries of one text. Even though future work on more than one source text is imperative, our experiments indicate that (1) ranking with regard to a single gold standard summary is insu-cient as rankings based on any two randomly chosen summaries are very dissimilar (correlations average %0 = 0:20), (2) a stable consensus summary can only be expected if a larger number of summaries are collected (in the range of at least 30-40 summaries), and (3) similarity measurement using unigrams shows a similarly low ranking correlation when compared with factoid-based ranking.</Paragraph>
