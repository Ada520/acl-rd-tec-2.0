Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach for automatically learning paraphrases from aligned mono-lingual corpora. Our algorithm works by generalizing the syntactic paths between corresponding anchors in aligned sentence pairs. Compared to previous work, structural paraphrases generated by our algorithm tend to be much longer on average, and are capable of capturing long-distance dependencies. In addition to a standalone evaluation of our paraphrases, we also describe a question answering application currently under development that could immensely benefit from automatically-learned structural paraphrases.</Paragraph>
