Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper describes two parsing schemes: a shallow approach based on machine learning and a cascaded finite-state parser with a hand-crafted grammar. It discusses several ways to combine them and presents evaluation results for the two individual approaches and their combination. An underspecification scheme for the output of the finite-state parser is introduced and shown to improve performance.</Paragraph>
