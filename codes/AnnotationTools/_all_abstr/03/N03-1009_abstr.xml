Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Previous work on minimizing weighted finite-state automata (including transducers) is limited to particular types of weights.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present efficient new minimization algorithms that apply much more generally, while being simpler and about as fast.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We also point out theoretical limits on minimization algorithms. We characterize the kind of &amp;quot;well-behaved&amp;quot; weight semirings where our methods work. Outside these semirings, minimization is not well-defined (in the sense of producing a unique minimal automaton), and even finding the minimum number of states is in general NP-complete and inapproximable.</Paragraph>
