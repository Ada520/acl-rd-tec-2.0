Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we study the effectiveness of applying sentence compression on an extraction based multi-document summarization system. Our results show that pure syntactic-based compression does not improve system performance. Topic signature-based reranking of compressed sentences does not help much either.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> However reranking using an oracle showed a significant improvement remains possible.</Paragraph>
