Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a Question Answering system for technical domains which makes an intelligent use of paraphrases to increase the likelihood of nding the answer to the user's question. The system implements a simple and e cient logic representation of questions and answers that maps paraphrases to the same underlying semantic representation. Further, paraphrases of technical terminology are dealt with by a separate process that detects surface variants.</Paragraph>
