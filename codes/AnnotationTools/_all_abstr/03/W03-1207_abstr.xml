</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The discovery of semantic relations from text becomes increasingly important for applications such as Question Answering, Information Extraction, Summarization, Text Understanding and others. This paper presents a method for the automatic discovery of manner relations using a Naive Bayes learning algorithm. The method was tested on the UPenn Treebank2 corpus, and the targeted manner relations were detected with a precision of 64.44% and a recall of 68.67%.</Paragraph>
