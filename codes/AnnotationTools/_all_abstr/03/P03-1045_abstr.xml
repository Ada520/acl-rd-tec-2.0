Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper is concerned with learning categorial grammars in Gold's model. In contrast to k-valued classical categorial grammars, k-valued Lambek grammars are not learnable from strings. This result was shown for several variants but the question was left open for the weakest one, the non-associative variant NL.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We show that the class of rigid and k-valued NL grammars is unlearnable from strings, for each k; this result is obtained by a specific construction of a limit point in the considered class, that does not use product operator.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Another interest of our construction is that it provides limit points for the whole hierarchy of Lambek grammars, including the recent pregroup grammars.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> Such a result aims at clarifying the possible directions for future learning algorithms: it expresses the difficulty of learning categorial grammars from strings and the need for an adequate structure on examples. null</Paragraph>
