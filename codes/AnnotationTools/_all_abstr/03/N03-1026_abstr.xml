<Paragraph position="0"> We present an application of ambiguity packing and stochastic disambiguation techniques for Lexical-Functional Grammars (LFG) to the domain of sentence condensation. Our system incorporates a linguistic parser/generator for LFG, a transfer component for parse reduction operating on packed parse forests, and a maximum-entropy model for stochastic output selection. Furthermore, we propose the use of standard parser evaluation methods for automatically evaluating the summarization quality of sentence condensation systems. An experimental evaluation of summarization quality shows a close correlation between the automatic parse-based evaluation and a manual evaluation of generated strings. Overall summarization quality of the proposed system is state-of-the-art, with guaranteed grammaticality of the system output due to the use of a constraint-based parser/generator.</Paragraph>
