Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Though dynamic programming matching can carry out approximate string matching when there may be deletions or insertions in a document, its effectiveness and efficiency are usually too poor to use it for large-scale information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a method of dynamic programming matching for information retrieval. This method is as effective as a conventional information retrieval system, even though it is capable of approximate matching. It is also as efficient as a conventional system.</Paragraph>
