Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a system for automatically identifying PropBank-style semantic roles based on the output of a statistical parser for Combinatory Categorial Grammar.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This system performs at least as well as a system based on a traditional Treebank parser, and outperforms it on core argument roles.</Paragraph>
