Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes techniques for unsupervised word sense disambiguation of English and German medical documents using UMLS. We present both monolingual techniques which rely only on the structure of UMLS, and bilingual techniques which also rely on the availability of parallel corpora. The best results are obtained using relations between terms given by UMLS, a method which achieves 74% precision, 66% coverage for English and 79% precision, 73% coverage for German on evaluation corporaandover83%coverageoverthe whole corpus. The success of this technique for German shows that a lexical resource giving relations between concepts used to index an English document collection can be used for high quality disambiguation in another language.</Paragraph>
