Abstract

<Paragraph position="0"> We present an unsupervised learning strategy for word sense disambiguation (WSD) that exploits multiple linguistic resources including a parallel corpus, a bi-lingual machine readable dictionary, and a thesaurus. The approach is based on Class Based Sense Definition Model (CBSDM) that generates the glosses and translations for a class of word senses. The model can be applied to resolve sense ambiguity for words in a parallel corpus. That sense tagging procedure, in effect, produces a semantic bilingual concordance, which can be used to train WSD systems for the two languages involved. Experimental results show that CBSDM trained on</Paragraph>
