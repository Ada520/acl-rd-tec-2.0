Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a novel approach for finding discontinuities that outperforms previously published results on this task.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Rather than using a deeper grammar formalism, our system combines a simple unlexicalized PCFG parser with a shallow pre-processor. This pre-processor, which we call a trace tagger, does surprisingly well on detecting where discontinuities can occur without using phase structure information.</Paragraph>
