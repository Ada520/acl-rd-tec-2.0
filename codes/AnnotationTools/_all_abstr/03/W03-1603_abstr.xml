Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a new method of ranking near-synonyms ordered by their suitability of nuances in a particular context. Our method distincts near-synonyms by semantic features extracted from their definition statements in an ordinary dictionary, and ranks them by the types of features and a particular context. Our method is an initial step to achieve a semantic paraphrase system for authoring support.</Paragraph>
