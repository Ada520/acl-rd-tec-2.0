Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we investigate the phenomenon of verb-particle constructions, discussing their characteristics and their availability for use with NLP systems. We concentrate in particular on the coverage provided by some electronic resources.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Given the constantly growing number of verb-particle combinations, possible ways of extending the coverage of the available resources are investigated, taking into account regular patterns found in some productive combinations of verbs and particles. We discuss, in particular, the use of Levin's (1993) classes of verbs as a means to obtain productive verb-particle constructions, and discuss the issues involved in adopting such an approach.</Paragraph>
