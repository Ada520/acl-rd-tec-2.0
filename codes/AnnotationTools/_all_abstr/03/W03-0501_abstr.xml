Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents Hedge Trimmer, a HEaDline GEneration system that creates a headline for a newspaper story using linguistically-motivated heuristics to guide the choice of a potential headline. We present feasibility tests used to establish the validity of an approach that constructs a headline by selecting words in order from a story. In addition, we describe experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our linguistically-motivated approach over a HMM-based model, using both human evaluation and automatic metrics for comparing the two approaches.</Paragraph>
