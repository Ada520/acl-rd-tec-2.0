Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a bootstrapping process that learns linguistically rich extraction patterns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> High-precision classifiers label unannotated data to automatically create a large training set, which is then given to an extraction pattern learning algorithm. The learned patterns are then used to identify more subjective sentences.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The bootstrapping process learns many subjective patterns and increases recall while maintaining high precision.</Paragraph>
