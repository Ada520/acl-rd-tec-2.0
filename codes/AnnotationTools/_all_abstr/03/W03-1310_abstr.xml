Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe our work in progress on natural language analysis in medical question-answering in the context of a broader medical text-retrieval project. We analyze the limitations in the medical domain of the technologies that have been developed for general question-answering systems, and describe an alternative approach whose organizing principle is the identification of semantic roles in both question and answer texts that correspond to the fields of PICO format.</Paragraph>
