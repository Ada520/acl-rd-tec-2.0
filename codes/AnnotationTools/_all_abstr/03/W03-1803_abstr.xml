Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The translation of compound nouns is a major issue in machine translation due to their frequency of occurrence and high productivity. Various shallow methods have been proposed to translate compound nouns, notable amongst which are memory-based machine translation and word-to-word compositional machine translation. This paper describes the results of a feasibility study on the ability of these methods to translate Japanese and English noun-noun compounds. null</Paragraph>
