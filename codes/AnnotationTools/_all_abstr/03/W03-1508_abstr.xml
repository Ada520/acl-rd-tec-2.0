Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We address the problem of transliterating English names using Chinese orthography in support of cross-lingual speech and text processing applications. We demonstrate the application of statistical machine translation techniques to &amp;quot;translate&amp;quot; the phonemic representation of an English name, obtained by using an automatic text-to-speech system, to a sequence of initials and finals, commonly used sub-word units of pronunciation for Chinese.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We then use another statistical translation model to map the initial/final sequence to Chinese characters. We also present an evaluation of this module in retrieval of Mandarin spoken documents from the TDT corpus using English text queries.</Paragraph>
