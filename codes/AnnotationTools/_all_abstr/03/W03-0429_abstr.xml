</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach to named entity recognition that uses support vector machines to capture transition probabilities in a lattice. The support vector machines are trained with hundreds of thousands of features drawn from the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task training data. Margin outputs are converted to estimated probabilities using a simple static function. Performance is evaluated using the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task test set; Test B results were Fb=1 = 84.67 for English, and Fb=1 = 69.96 for German. null</Paragraph>
