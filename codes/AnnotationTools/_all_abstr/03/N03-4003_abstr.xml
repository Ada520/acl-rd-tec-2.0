</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes DOGHED (Dialog Output Generator for HEterogeneous Devices), a multimodal generation component which is a part of a dialog system that supports adaptation of multimodal content based on user preferences and their current device. Existing dialog systems focus on generating output for a single device that might not be suitable when users access the system using different devices. Multimedia presentation systems can be built that support several device types. However, most content presentation and layout is done off-line and defined at the document level.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Dialog facilitates the process of tailoring the interaction to the dynamically changing needs of the user. With support for dialog, a computer can regulate the pace at which users receive content, help focus the user's attention, and interleave actions that will help the system monitor (and adjust) to the user's understanding or satisfaction. Minimally, dialog systems should adapt the interaction to the user's ability to understand. However, dialog systems should also be able to adapt to the user's computing environment, because people access computers not only through traditional workstations and terminals, but also through personal digital assistants and cellular telephones. Each of these devices has a distinct set of physical capabilities, as well as a distinct set of functions for which it is typically used.</Paragraph>
