Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Story link detection has been regarded as a core technology for other Topic Detection and Tracking tasks such as new event detection. In this paper we analyze story link detection and new event detection in a retrieval framework and examine the effect of a number of techniques, including part of speech tagging, new similarity measures, and an expanded stop list, on the performance of the two detection tasks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present experimental results that show that the utility of the techniques on the two tasks differs, as is consistent with our analysis.</Paragraph>
