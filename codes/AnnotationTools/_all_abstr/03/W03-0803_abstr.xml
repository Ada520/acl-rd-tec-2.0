Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports work aimed at developing an open, distributed learning environment, OLLIE, where researchers can experiment with different Machine Learning (ML) methods for Information Extraction.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Once the required level of performance is reached, the ML algorithms can be used to speed up the manual annotation process.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> OLLIE uses a browser client while data storage and ML training is performed on servers. The different ML algorithms use a unified programming interface; the integration of new ones is straightforward.</Paragraph>
