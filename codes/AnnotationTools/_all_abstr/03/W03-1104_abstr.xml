Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We have developed an effective probabilistic classifier for document classification by introducing the concept of the differential document vectors and DLSI (differential latent semantics index) spaces. A simple posteriori calculation using the intra- and extra-document statistics demonstrates the advantage of the DLSI space-based probabilistic classifier over the popularly used LSI space-based classifier in classification performance.</Paragraph>
