Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we propose an automatic quantitative expansion method for a sentence set that contains sentences of the same meaning (called an equivalent sentence set). This task is regarded as paraphrasing. The features of our method are: 1) The paraphrasing rules are dynamically acquired by Hierarchical Phrase Alignment from the equivalent sentence set, and 2) A large equivalent sentence set is generated by substituting source syntactic structures. Our experiments show that 561 sentences on average are correctly generated from 8.48 equivalent sentences.</Paragraph>
