Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Standard IR systems can process queries such as &amp;quot;web NOT internet&amp;quot;, enabling users who are interested in arachnids to avoid documents about computing. The documents retrieved for such a query should be irrelevant to the negated query term. Most systems implement this by reprocessing results after retrieval to remove documents containing the unwanted string of letters.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper describes and evaluates a theoretically motivated method for removing unwanted meanings directly from the original query in vector models, with the same vector negation operator as used in quantum logic. Irrelevance in vector spaces is modelled using orthogonality, so query vectors are made orthogonal to the negated term or terms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> As well as removing unwanted terms, this form of vector negation reduces the occurrence of synonyms and neighbours of the negated terms by as much as 76% compared with standard Boolean methods. By altering the query vector itself, vector negation removes not only unwanted strings but unwanted meanings.</Paragraph>
