Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes our preliminary attempt to automatically recognize zero adnominals, a subgroup of zero pronouns, in Japanese discourse. Based on the corpus study, we define and classify what we call &amp;quot;argument-taking nouns (ATNs),&amp;quot; i.e., nouns that can appear with zero adnominals. We propose an ATN recognition algorithm that consists of lexicon-based heuristics, drawn from the observations of our analysis. We finally present the result of the algorithm evaluation and discuss future directions.</Paragraph>
