Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems need to integrate a wide variety of information for optimal performance. This paper demonstrates that a maximum entropy tagger can effectively encode such information and identify named entities with very high accuracy. The tagger uses features which can be obtained for a variety of languages and works effectively not only for English, but also for other languages such as German and Dutch.</Paragraph>
