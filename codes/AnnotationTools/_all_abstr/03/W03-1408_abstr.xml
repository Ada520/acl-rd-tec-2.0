<Paragraph position="0"> The objective of this paper is to present a new dimension of Game Theoretic Semantics (GTS) using the idea of the cordination problem game to explain the semantics of metaphor. A metaphorical expresion  such as 'man is a wolf' is a contradictory statement that insists al objects in the set of 'man' also fals under 'wolf'. The study of metaphorical expression should be on intentions of such contradictory language use, their intended efect, and the conditions to lead to the effects. This is the tradition of Rhetoric since Aristotle. It may be natural to characterize this aproach as pragmatic in the tradition of the late 20th century paradigm of linguistics, which is the trichotomy of syntax, semantics and pragmatics. However the pragmatic aproach canot explain what Richards (1936) caled 'tension' betwen two thoughts in a metaphorical expresion. GTS has ben devel- null In this paper, I say 'metaphorical expresion' rather than 'metaphor'. 'Metaphor' is comonly used as a topic, but it is used at word level in traditional rhetoric and at sentence level after Black. Also, 'metaphor' is used for both metaphorical expresion and a kind of trope. So I use 'metaphorical expresion' to refer linguistic expresion which is comonly caled 'metaphor'. oped as a posible substitute to the Tarskian truth conditional semantics. This paper explores a new posibility of GTS in the cordination problem game introduced by Lewis (1961) for a semantics, which admits the plurality of meanings.</Paragraph>
