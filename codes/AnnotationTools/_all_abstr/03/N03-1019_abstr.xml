Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a derivation of the alignment template model for statistical machine translation and an implementation of the model using weighted finite state transducers. The approach we describe allows us to implement each constituent distribution of the model as a weighted finite state transducer or acceptor. We show that bitext word alignment and translation under the model can be performed with standard FSM operations involving these transducers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> One of the benefits of using this framework is that it obviates the need to develop specialized search procedures, even for the generation of lattices or N-Best lists of bitext word alignments and translation hypotheses. We evaluate the implementation of the model on the French-to-English Hansards task and report alignment and translation performance.</Paragraph>
