Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Sources of training data suitable for language modeling of conversational speech are limited.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, we show how training data can be supplemented with text from the web filtered to match the style and/or topic of the target recognition task, but also that it is possible to get bigger performance gains from the data by using class-dependent interpolation of N-grams.</Paragraph>
