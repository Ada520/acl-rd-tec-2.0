Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Paraphrases, which stem from the variety of lexical and grammatical means of expressing meaning available in a language, pose challenges for a sentence generation system. In this paper, we discuss the generation of paraphrases from predicate#2Fargument structure using a simple, uniform generation methodology. Central to our approach are lexico-grammatical resources which pair elementary semantic structures with their syntactic realization and a simple but powerful mechanism for combining resources.</Paragraph>
