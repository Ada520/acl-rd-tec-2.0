<Paragraph position="0"> Because of the complexity of documents and the variety of applications which must be supported, document understanding requires the integration of image understanding with text understanding. Our docum(,nt understanding technology is implemented in a system called IDUS (Intelligent Document Undcrstanding System), which creates the data for a text retrieval application and the automatic generation of hyperttrxt li.ks.
