<Paragraph position="0"> Sulnmary: Optimality Theory is a constraint-based Iheoly of phonology which allows constraints to conllict aad to be violated. Consequently, implementing the theory presents problems for declarative constraint-based processing frameworks. On the hasis of two regularity assumptions, that sets are regular and that constraints can bc model-. led by transducers, this paper presenls and proves correct algorithms for computing the action of constrainls, and hence deriving surface forms.</Paragraph>
