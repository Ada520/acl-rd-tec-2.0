PROGRAM GOALS
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The major objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high performance continuous speech recognition (CSR) techniques focussed on application in Spoken Language Systems (SLS) which will enhance the effectiveness of military and civilian computer-based systems. A key complementary objective is to define and develop applications of robust speech recognition and understanding systems, and to help catalyze the transition of spoken language technology into military and civilian systems, with particular focus on application of robust CSR to mobile military command and control. The research effort focusses on developing advanced acoustic modelling, rapid search, and recognition-time adaptation techniques for robust large-vocabulary CSR, and on applying these techniques to the new ARPA large-vocabulary CSR corpora and to military application tasks.</Paragraph>
