<Paragraph position="0"> A new type of stochatstic grammars is introduced tor inw~stigation: weakly restricted stochastic grammars. In this p~Lper we will concentrate oil the consistcl,cy prol)lcnt. ~1'o find conditions for stoch~stlc gramma.rs to be consistm~t, the theory of multitype Galton-Watson branciting processes and gelmrating functions is of central ilnporl,~utce.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The unrestricted stochastic grammar formalism generates the s~tme class of langu~gcs as the wc~kly rcstricl.cd for malisln, q'}te inside-outside algorithm is adapt.cd for use with weakly restricted granlmars.</Paragraph>
