Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports on the techniques used to successfully translate with the help of a computer a Mathematics textbook from Portuguese to English. Even if these techniques are simple and this case has some peculiarities, it seems that the same method will be useful in other cases as well, and, more importantly, that this experience is a good motivation for some research to be done on the possible refinements of the method.</Paragraph>
