Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a system of 97 verbal semantic attributes for Japanese verbs which considers both dynamic characteristics and the relationship of verbs to cases. These attribute values are used to disambiguate the meanings of all Japanese and English pattern pairs in a Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionary consisting of 15,000 pairs of Japanese valence patterns and equivalent English syntactic structures.</Paragraph>
