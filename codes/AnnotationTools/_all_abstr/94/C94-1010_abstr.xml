DII, EMMA- AN INSTANT LEXICOGItAPIlER
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> IIANS KAItLGREN, JUSSI I(~AII.I,GREN, NIAGNUS NORDSTR()M, PAUL PETTI,;R, SSON, P, ENGT ~'VAIlItOI,I{N di?-emma~s+-cs, se Swedish Institute of Computer Science Box 1263, 164 28 Kista, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction Dilemma is intended to enhance quality and increase productivity of expert human translators by prese,,ti,,g to the writer relewmt lexical information ,necha,dcally extracted from comparable existing translations, thus replacing - or compensating for the ahsence of- a lexicographer and stand-by terminologist rather than the translator. Using statistics and crude surface analysis and a minimum of prior information, Dihnn,,,a identities instances and suggests their counterparts in I)aralh!l source and target texts, on all levels down to individual words.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Dilemma forms part of a tool kit for t,'anslation where focus is on text structure and over-all consistency in large text volumes rather than on framing sentences, on interaction between many actors in a large project rather than on retriewd of machine-stored data and on decision making rather than on application of give,) rules.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> In particular, the system has been tuned to the needs of the ongoing translation of European Con,n,unity legislation into the languages of candidate me,,,her countries. '/'he system has been demonstrated to and used by professional translators with promising results.</Paragraph>

Instant Lexicographer
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The design of translation aids beyond ordinary texl. processing and database accession and maintenance tools is mostly based on the same sinai)lifted view which ....</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> for compelling reasons -- has been the worki,,g hyl&gt;othesis of machine translation: that the source text. has a well-determined meaning and that there exists in the target language at least one correct and adequate ways of expressing that meaning.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> When these assumptions are reasonably well justifled, translation is relatively easy, fast and cheap with traditional methods and mechanization not rarely feasible with methods now known or envisaged. Typically, however, the translator must do more tha.n retrieve and operate on we-established a,,d in principle pre-storable correspondences. Thus, lexical correspondences do not exist for all items; it is an essential part of translation to establish them. Legal texts, factual and stereotype though they may see,n, re.gularly represent thoughts, attitudes and arguments which do not haw'. any counterparts in the. target language prior to translation. This is particulary true in the huge project to translate the European Community legislation into the languages of countries which are not yet members of tile (\]omnmnity and which currently have a partly different legal conceptual framework.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> What human translators need is decision supl)ort.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> The most imlmrtant tools are telelfl,ones , electronical C/'onfi.'rencing systems and good and relevant dictiol,aries. Unfortunately, there are not always at ew~'ry point of time ltnowledgalAe and cooperative colleagues or othe.r experts to call, eh.'ctronical networks ~tre only recently being established in some domMns, and the intelligent and comprehensive dictionaries, which can serve as a writer's digest to the cumulative literature it, a fiehl are few and far between. Answers are ofl.en to be found in a text translated late at night the day beR)re - or in the preceding sections of the text at hand.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> R.ather than all autolnated writer, we need an instant h!xicographer.</Paragraph>

Recycling Translations
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In practh:e, existing translations are being used as a major source (Shgvall llein et at, 1990; Merkel 1993).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Often in the hope to be able to avoid duplication of costs - or of getting paid twice for the same ellbrt by findirlg identical or near-identical texts or passages, hut, more hnportantly, to ensure consistency or getting good suggestions, to follow or argue against. Synonymy wu'ial.iou for the salne concept is not al)lU'eclated in technical and legal prose and avoided as anxiously :m ilOlllOnyllly, The ideal is I: I corresllondeltces \])etweell expressions at least within one pair of documents and to eliminate &amp;quot;forks&amp;quot;, i.e.., one expression being translated hlto or beil,g the trm,slation of more than one counte.rpart in the other language (Karlgren, 1988).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We slmll call a c.o,,pled pair of source and target text a bitc~'Z (Isabelle, 1992). Wlmt is said here abou't bitexts ca,, be generalized to n-tnples of parallel texts, claimed to dilfer &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; in hmguage. Such n-tuph.'s exist: in the l!htropean Comnn,nity, a major part of the legislatiou is available in 9 &amp;quot;authenth:&amp;quot; versions, which in (legal and political) theory are equivalent, and according to plans the number of &amp;quot;authentic&amp;quot; will soon rise to 12 or more. l,ittle efforts have previously been made to systematically exploit this redunda,,cy by means of po- null tent multi-lingual procedures for retrieving faet.s or exl)ressions, even when surprisingly simple methods show l)romise of surprisingly useful results (l)ahlqvist, 1994).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> Steps in the '\]h-anslation Process l'roducing target language text is only a small l)ropor lion of the translation l)rocess. Eml)irically, good economy is achieved if about the same proportion of work is put into each of the stages Preparation, Text pro ductiou and Verification, a trichotomy reminiscent of tile classical person-time breakdown of software devel opment (Brooks, 1975). The Dilemma tool is usct'ul for some t~usks in each of the three stages.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Funct;ionality A typical question for translators while actually wt'it.inu, is how a word or phrase has been used or translated in l)reviously processed texts. Conversely, they may ask for the source languages counl.erl)art:; of given target language expression, to lnalC/.e sure that homonyn,y is not introduced. Similarly, during the I)reparation and verification phases, a translator or editor scans through the text for words and phrases that need to be resolw&gt;d or treated specially.</Paragraph>

Text Production Phase
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Navigating in Bitexts The first service is to enM)le the translator to I)rowse through the bitext and look at text elements pairwise, to cheek |br conventions of usage that are unfamiliar or unexpected.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Pointing at a shorter or longer string ill eitl,cr language the user can film successively larger contexts and their counterparts or covnlerlezls in the other l;mguage version. This service is available to the user from within a word processor, tile allsWeF pres(.qlted ill a selmi'ate wiudow.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> COllllt i!l'IVor(|s The second service is to assess the word-lcwq COlllltol'parts or &amp;quot;eounterwords&amp;quot; so far used for a given word. llere the system performs, crudely but instantly, the job of a terminologist or lexic.ographer. It uses a statistical matching process which offers the translator a list, of candidate counterl)arts.</Paragraph>
