ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we demonstrate that speech recognition can be effectively applied to information retrieval (IR) applications.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our system exploits the fact that the intended words of a spoken query tend to co-occur in text documents in close proximity whereas word combinations that are the result of recognition errors are usually not semantically correlated and thus do not appear together. Termed &amp;quot;Semantic Co-occurrence Filtering&amp;quot; this enables the system to simultaneously disambiguate word hypotheses and find relevant text for retrieval.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The system is built by integrating standard IR and speech recognition techniques. An evaluation of the system is preseated and we discuss several refinements to the functionality.</Paragraph>
