Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Frequency information on co-occurrence patterns can be atttomatically collected from a syntactically analyzed corpus; this information can then serve as the basis for selectional constraints when analyzing new text; from the same domain. Tiffs information, however, is necessarily incomplete. We report on measurements of the degree of selectional coverage obtained with ditt\~rent sizes of corpora. We then describe a technique for using the corpus to identify selectionally similar terms, and for using tiffs similarity to broaden the seleetional coverage for a tixed corpus size.</Paragraph>
