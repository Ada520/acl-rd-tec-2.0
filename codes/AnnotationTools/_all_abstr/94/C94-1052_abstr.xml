Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the enhancements made, within a unification framework, based on typed feature structures, in order to support linking of lexical entries to their translation equivalents. To help this task we have developed an interactive environment: TGE. Several experiments, corresponding to rather &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot; semantic domains, have been developed in order to generate lexical cross-relations between English and Spanish.</Paragraph>
