Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Research in discourse processing has ident~ed two representational requirements for discourse planning systems. First, discourse plans must adequately represent the intentional structure of the utterances they produce in order to enable a computations.\] discourse agent to respond effectively to communicative failures \[15\]. Second, discourse plans must represent the information~ structure of utterances. In addition to these representational requirements, we argue that discourse planners ahonid be formally characterizab\]e in terms of soundness and completeness.</Paragraph>
