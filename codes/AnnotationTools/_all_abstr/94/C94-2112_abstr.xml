Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we discuss the phenomenon of logical polysemy in natural language as ~ddressed by Generative Lexicon Theory. We discuss generally the role of type and sortal coercion operations in the selnantics, and specifically the conditions on the application of coercion in aspectual predicates and other contexts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We reply to some recent discussion regarding the use of coercion in the grammar, and show that type changing operations are both useful and explanatory mechanisms for capturing linguistic and computatioiml gcll eraliza.tions.</Paragraph>
