Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We report on a head-driven way to generate a language-specific representation for a language-independent conceptual structure. With a grammar oriented towards conceptual rather than phrasal structure, the approach shows some advant~ages over previous works in head-driven generation. ~It is particularly suited for multi-lingual generation systems where language-independent representations andlprocesses should be maintained to a maximum extent. We briefly sketch the architecture of our Genie system based on some results of an analysis of a technical manual for a gearbox.</Paragraph>
