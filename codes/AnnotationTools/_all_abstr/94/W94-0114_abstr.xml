1. Summary
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We discuss implementation issues of MARIE-l, a mostly symbolic parser fully implemented, and MARIE-2, a more statistical parser partially implemented. They address a corpus of 100,000 picture captions. We argue that the mixed approach of MARIE-2 should be better for this corpus because its algorithms (not data) are simpler.</Paragraph>
