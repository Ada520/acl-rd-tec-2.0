ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents and evaluates models created according to a schema that provides a description of the joint distribution of the values of sense tags and contextual features that is potentially applicable to a wide range of content words.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The models are evaluated through a series of experiments, the results of which suggest that the schema is particularly well suited to nouns but that it is also applicable to words in other syntactic categories.</Paragraph>
