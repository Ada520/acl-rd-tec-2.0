ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The key problem to be faced when building a HMM-based continuous speech recogniser is maintaining the balance between model complexity and available training data. For large vocabulary systems requiring cross-word context dependent modelling, this is particularly acute since many mmh contexts will never occur in the training data. This paper describes a method of creating a tied-state continuous speech recognition system using a phonetic decision tree. This tree-based clustering is shown to lead to similar recognition performance to that obtained using an earlier data-driven approach but to have the additional advantage of providing a mapping for unseen triphones. State-tying is also compared with traditional model-based tying and shown to be clearly superior. Experimental results are presented for both the Resource Management and Wall Street 3ournal tasks.</Paragraph>
