Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction. Bottom-up deduction is preferable to top-down deduction because it allows incrementai processing (even for head-driven grammars), it is data-driven, no subsumption check is needed, and preference values attached to lexical items can be used to guide best-first search. We discuss the scanning step for bottom-up Earley deduction and indexing schemes that help avoid useless deduction steps.</Paragraph>
