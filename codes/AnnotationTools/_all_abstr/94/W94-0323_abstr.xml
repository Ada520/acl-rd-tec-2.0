</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> NL-Soar is a computer system that performs language comprehension and generation within the framework of the Soar architecture \[New90\]. NL-Soar provides language capabilities for systems working in a real-time environment. Responding in real time to changing situations requires a flexible way to shift control between language and task operations. To provide this flexibility, NL-Soar organizes generation as a sequence of incremental steps that can be interleaved with task actions as the situation requires. This capability has been demonstrated via the integration of NL-Soar with two different independentlydeveloped Soar-based systems.</Paragraph>
