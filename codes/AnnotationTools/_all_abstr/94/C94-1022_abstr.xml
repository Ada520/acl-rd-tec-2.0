Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an integrated architecture for word-level and sentence-level processing in a unification-based paradigm. The core of the system is a CLP implementation of a nnilication engine for feature structures suplmrting relational values. In this framework an IiPSC,-style granlmar is implemented. Word-level processing uses X2MoltF, a morphological component I)ased on an extended version of two-level morphology. This component is tightly integrated with the grammar as a relation. The advantage of this apl)roach is that morphology and syntax are kept logically autonomous while at the same time minimizing interface problems.</Paragraph>
