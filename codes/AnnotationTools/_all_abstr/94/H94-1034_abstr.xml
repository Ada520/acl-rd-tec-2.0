ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a method of detecting speechrepairs that uses a part-of-speech tagger. The tagger is given knowledge about category transitions for speechrepairs, and so is able to mark a transition either as a likely repair or as fluent speech. Other contextual clues, such as editing terms, word fragments, and word matchings, are also factored in by modifying the transition probabilities.</Paragraph>
