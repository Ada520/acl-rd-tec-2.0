<Paragraph position="1"> Summary This article presents a novel Chinese class n-gram model for contextual postprocessing of haudwriting recognition results. The word classes in the model are automatically discovered by a corpus-based simulated anuealing procedure. Three other language models, least-word, word-frequency, and the powerflfl inter-word character bigram model, have been constructed for comparison. Extensive experiments on large text corpora show that the discovered class bigram model outperforms the other three competing models.</Paragraph>
