</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A CYK-table-driven interactive relaxation parsing method of spoken Korean, integrated with the CYK-based morphological analysis is introduced. An extension of the Categorial Grammar is introduced to treat the fiee word-order in Korean. The table-driven control of interactive relaxation gives efficiency in constituent searching and expectation generation. 'File lexical nature of the Categorial Grammar and the distributed nature of the interactive relaxation parsing together show a smooth integration of both bottom-up and toFdown effects during the spoken language analysis.</Paragraph>
