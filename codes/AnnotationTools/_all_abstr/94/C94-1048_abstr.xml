A simpler way is I:o look t;he ECs u I) in l;he inverse (li(:t,i(mary. For extoni)l('. ~ (,he (:ml consult Dic, ,j for COml)6.tition , contours, a u(I rac(', a, ud du;reby gel; ~9, J , De,  flY&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;&amp;}i~&amp;quot; (jinshu : human race) as their respective equivalencies. Since &amp;quot;.&amp;~i\[(&amp;quot; has notl,ing to do with &amp;quot;~(/,'&amp;quot;, race is excluded. We call this inethod of looking up ECs in the inverse dictionaries when choosing relevant equivalencies inverse consultation, and we call the words obtained by looking up inverse dictionaries the selection area (SA). Inverse consultation utilizes the. structure of dictionaries to measure the nearness of the meanings of words in (tiff&gt;rent languages.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="13"> The simplest application of inverse consultation is to use Dic~_,~. In the above example, each EC is looked up in Dict_,e and the results are compared with the English equivalencies of &amp;quot;)~'6&amp;quot;&amp;quot; (E); namely, competition, contest, and race. The SA of eompdtitlon is competition, contest and match, which have tile elements contest and competition in common with E (Fig. 2). As compdtition derived from competition, competition should be put aside, but contest is still left as a common element and thus compdtition is selected as an equivalence of '&amp;quot;~(P&amp;quot;'. As for race, the SA of race consists of race and ancestry, whose intersection with E only gives race; so race is judged as an inadequate EC. In shorl;, the number of elements in common between the selection area and E indicates the nearness of the meaning between the EC and the original word.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="14"> For the inverse consultation (lmseril)ed above, the SA was in English. If we use Dice~j as an inverse dictionary successively afl;er consult&gt; ing Dic~-.e, then the SA is in Japanese an(1 we ~f\[' with the SA (Fig. 3). The.
