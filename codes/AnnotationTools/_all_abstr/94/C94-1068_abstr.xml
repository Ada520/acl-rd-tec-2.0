Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We. have developed a parser generator for natural language i)rocessing. The generator named &amp;quot;NLyace&amp;quot; accepts grammar rules written in the Yacc format. NLyacc, unlike Yacc, can handle arbitrary context-free grammars using the generalized Lll. parsing Mgorithm. The parser produced by NLyacc elliciently parses given sentences and executes semantic actions. NLyacc, which is a free and sharable software, runs on UNIX workstations and personal computers.</Paragraph>
