Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose A parAdigm for concurrent n;~tura\[ lAnguAge generation. In order to represent grammar rules distributively, we adopt categorial unificAtion grammar (CUG) Where eaclh category owns its functional type. We mlgment typed IAmbda cah:ulus with severM new combim~tors, to m~ke the o:rder of ,~-conversions free :for partial / locM processing. The concurrent calculus is modeled with Ch, emical Abstract Machine. We show An exAmple of A JapAnese causative auxiliary verb that requires A drAstic reArrAngement of case dolninAtio:n. null</Paragraph>
