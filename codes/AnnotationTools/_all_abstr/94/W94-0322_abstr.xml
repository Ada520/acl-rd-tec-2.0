Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An indirect answer to! a Yes-No question conversationally implicates the speaker's evaluation of the truth of the questioned proposition. We present the approach to generation used in our implemented system for generating and interpret~ing indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English. Generation of a discourse plan is performed in two phases: content planning and plan pruning. During content planning, stimulus conditions are used to trigger speaker goals to include appropriate extra information wit h the direct answer. Plan pruning determines what parts of this full response do not need to be stated explicitly - resulting in, in appropriate discourse contexts, the generation of an indirect answer.</Paragraph>
