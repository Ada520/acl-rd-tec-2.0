</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a method that automatically acquires the SAs (semantic attributes) of user defined words. Applying this method to the compilation of a user dictionary targeting newspaper article sentences and sentences of software design documents has revealed that the automatically determined SAs include 50 to 80% of the correct attributes. Translation experiments confirmed that the automatically acquired SAs improved translation quality by 6-13%.</Paragraph>
