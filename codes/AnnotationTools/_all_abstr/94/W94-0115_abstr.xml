Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a prototype system which induces a categorial grammar from a simple text corpus of children's reading books. Unlike previous attempts at grammar induction, (I) there are no rules of grammar, only a richly structured lexicon; (2) we rely both on an informing linguistic theory and on statistical methods applied to a corpus.</Paragraph>
