Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A new, flexible inference method for Horn logic program is proposed. It is also a drastic gencndization of chart I)aming, partial instaatiation of clauses in a program ronghly corresponding to arcs in a chart. Chart-like i)al~ing and semantic-head-driven generation emerge from this method. With a parsimonious instantiation scheme for ambiguity packing, the parsing eoml)lexity reduces to that of standard chart-based algorithms.</Paragraph>
