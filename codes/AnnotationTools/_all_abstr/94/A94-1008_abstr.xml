Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We discuss combining knowledge-based (or rule-based) and statistical part-of-speech taggers. We use two mature taggers, ENGCG and Xerox Tagger, to independently tag the same text and combine the results to produce a fully disambiguated text. In a 27000 word test sample taken from a previously unseen corpus we achieve 98.5 % accuracy. This paper presents the data in detail. We describe the problems we encountered in the course of combining the two taggers and discuss the problem of evaluating taggers.</Paragraph>
