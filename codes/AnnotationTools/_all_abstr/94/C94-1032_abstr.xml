Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a novel method for segmenting the input sentence into words and assigning parts of speech to the words. It consists of a statistical language model and an efficient two-pa~qs N-best search algorithm. The algorithm does not require delimiters between words.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Thus it is suitable for written Japanese. q'he proposed Japanese morphological analyzer achieved 95. l% recall and 94.6% precision for open text when it was trained and tested on the ATI'C/ Corpus.</Paragraph>
