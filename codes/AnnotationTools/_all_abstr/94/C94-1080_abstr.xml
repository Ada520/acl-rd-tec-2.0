CONCURRENT LEXICALIZED DEPENDENCY PARSING:
A BEHAVIORAL VIEW ON ParseTalk EVENTS
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Abstract. The behavioral specification of an obj~t-oricnted grammar model is considered. The model is based on full lexicalization, hcad-oricntation via valency constraints and dependency relations, inhcritancc as a means for non-redundant lexicon specification, and conct, rrcncy of computation. The compntation model relies upon the actor l)aradigm, with concurrency entering throt~gh asyn~:hronous message passing between actors. In pa,ticular, we here elaborate on principlcs of how the global lyzhavior of a lexically distributexl grammar and its corresponding parser can be specified in terms of evcnt type networks and cvent networks, resp.</Paragraph>
