ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paperintroduces a simple mixtare language model that attempts to capture long distance conslraints in a sentence or paragraph. The model is an m-component mixture of Irigram models. The models were constructed using a 5K vocabulary and trained using a 76 million word Wail Street Journal text corpus. Using the BU recognition system, experiments show a 7% improvement in recognition accuracy with the mixture trigram models as compared to using a Irigram model.</Paragraph>
