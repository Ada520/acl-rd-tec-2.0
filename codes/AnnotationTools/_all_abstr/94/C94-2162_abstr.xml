<Paragraph position="0"> sandi~ay@research, nj. nec. corn .Abstract This paper describes how recent linguistic results in explaining Japanese short and long distance scram hling (:an be directly incorporated into an existing principles-and-parameters-based parser with only triviM modifications. '.\['he fact that this is realizable on a parser originally designed for a fixed-word-order language, together with the fact thai; Japanese scrambling is complex, attests to the high degree of cross linguistic generalization present in the theory.</Paragraph>
