Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe an approach to surface generation designed for a &amp;quot;pragmatics-based&amp;quot; dialogue system. The implementation has been extended to deal with certain well-known difficulties with the underlying linguistic formalism (Categorial Grammar) at the same time yielding a system capable of supporting incremental generation as well as interpretation. Aspects of the formalism used for the initial description that constitutes the interface with the planning component are also discussed.</Paragraph>
