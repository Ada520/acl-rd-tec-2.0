</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach to lexical knowledge representation where different uses of the same word can be conflated into a single meta-entry which encodes regnlarities about sense/usage extensibility.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This approach makes it possible to solve lexical anrbiguities by using contextual information (luring language processing to ground underspecified word entries, and can be efficiently implemented within a typed feature structure formalism.</Paragraph>
