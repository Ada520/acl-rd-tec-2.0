</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Polysemy is one of the major causes of difficulties in selnantic clustering of words in a corpus. In this paper, we first; give a definition of polysemy from the view-point of clustering and then, b~rsed on this definition, we propose a clustering method which reeognises verbal 1)olysemics from a textual corpus. The results of experiments denmnstrate the effectiveness of the pro-I)osed method.</Paragraph>
