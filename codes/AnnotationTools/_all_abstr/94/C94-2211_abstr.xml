</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A system for the acquisition and management of reusable morphological dictionaries is clearly a useful tool for NLP. As such, most currently popular finite-state morphology systems have a number of drawbacks. In the development of Word Manager, these problems have been taken into account. As a result, its knowledge acquisition component is well-developed, and its knowledge representation enables more flexible use than typical finite-state systems.</Paragraph>
