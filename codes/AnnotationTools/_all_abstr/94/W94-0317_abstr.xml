Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper deals with the reference choices involved in the generation of argumentative text. A piece of argumentative text such as the proof of a mathematical theorem conveys a sequence of derivations. For each step of derivation, the premises (previously conveyed intermediate results) and the inference method (such as the application of a particular theorem or definition) must be made clear. The appropriateness of these references crucially affects the quality of the text produced.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Although hot restricted to nominal phrases, our reference decisions are similar to those concerning nominal subsequent referring expressions: they depend on the availability of the object referred to within a context and are sensitive to its attentional hierarchy. In this paper, we show how the current context can be appropriately segmented into an attentional hierarchy by viewing text generation as a combination of planned and unplanned behavior, and how the discourse theory of Reichmann can be adapted to handle our special reference problem.</Paragraph>
