</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents Delphi, the natural language component of the BBN Spoken Language System. Delphi is a domain-independent natural language question answering system that is solidly based on linguistic principles, yet which is also robust to ungrammatical input. It includes a domain-independent, broad-coverage grammar of English. Analysis components include an agenda-based best-first parser and a fall-back component for partial understanding that works by fragment combination. Delphi has been formally evaluated in the ARPA Spoken Language program's ATIS (Airline Travel Information System) domain, and has performed well. Delphi has also been ported to a spoken language demonstration system in an Air Force Resource Management domain. We discuss results of the evaluation as well as the porting process.</Paragraph>
