<Paragraph position="0"> A critical issue in AI r(~sem'ch is to ov(.'r(:(ml(~ the knowh~(Ige acquisition bottleneck in knowl(!dge-tms(!d systems. As a knowledge base is eXlmn(led, adding more kn((wl(~dg(-` and fixing previ(ms err(m(~(Tus kn()w1edge become increasingly c(Tstly. Mor(~(Tv(w, maintaining the integrity of Ire'go knowledge bases has 17rovcn to be a very chall(mging task.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A wid(!ly im)i)(Tsed apl)roach t() deal with the knowl(~dg(~ a(:quisiti(m botth.uu~(:k is to employ some lcai'ning lll(-`ch}llliSi\[l to (~Xtl'}lct th(~ (\[csir(!d kni)wledge autornati(:a\]ly or semi-automatically from a(:tual (:ases (Tr examl)h!s \[lhmhamm &amp; \Vilkins \]993\].</Paragraph>

<Paragraph position="4"> So far, AI;F-J/E translation ruh!s have b(!en composed mam(ally by (~xtensiv(~ly trained human exl)('rts.

<Paragraph position="5"> Creating new translation rules as well as refining existing ones have In'OVen to lm cxtr(~mely difficult ;~ltid tiHl(~-COllSll(liill~ l)(?(:a/iSC thcsc t~(.sks r(~(l(lil'(! col(~ sidering a huge space ()f p(Tssibh~ comlTimtti(ms (rules in AI;\['-,I/E at(!

<Paragraph position="6"> 'I'h(-` aim ()f this work is to mak(! AUI.'-J/I,;'s tnmsla(.ion rubes less costly and more rcliabh-` through tim us(! ()t' inductive machi,l(' h'a,',lin/,; techni(lueS.

This is tmrticularly important because tile iHllllense Illllllb(w of translation rules (currently over 10,000) requires employing a team of experts over an extended l)eriod of tim(!.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="7"> Two learning methods are investigated in this i ml)er. Ext)eriments show that the rnles learned by these methods are very close to the rules mmmally COmliosed by hlllIt}tll experts.

<Paragraph position="9"> We begin in Section 2 by it brief overview of the AUI'-J/E Japanese-l.;nglish translation system. In Section 3, we discuss some of the 1)rol)lems that arise when the translation rules of ALT-J/E are composed manually })y }roman experts. Then, we t)ropose in Section 4 an alternative approach based on machine learning techniques. In Section 5, we describe the inductive learning methods used, followed by an experimental ewfluation of these methods in Section 6. Fimdly, conclusion remarks are stated in Section 7.</Paragraph>
