Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A methodology is presented for coml)onent-l)ase(l machine translation (MT) evaluation through causal error analysis to complement existing global evaluation methods. This methodology is particularly :q)propriate for knowledgc-I)ased machine translation (KBMT) systems. After a discussion o\[ M'I' evaluation criteria and the particular evahlatiou metrics proposed for KBMT, we apply this methodology to a large-scale application of the KANT ,nachinc translation system, and present some sample results.</Paragraph>
