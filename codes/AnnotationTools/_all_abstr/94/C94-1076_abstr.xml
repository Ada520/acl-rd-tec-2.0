Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Ideally, the time that an incremental algorithm uses to process a change should be a fimction of the size of the change rather than, say, the size of the entire current input. Based on a formalization of &amp;quot;the set of things changed&amp;quot; by an increInental modification, this paper investigates how and to what extent it is possibh~' to give such a guarantee for a chart-ba.se(l parsing frmnework and discusses the general utility of a tninlmality notion in incremental processing)</Paragraph>
