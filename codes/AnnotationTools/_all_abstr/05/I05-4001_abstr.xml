</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Domain knowledge is the fundamental resources required by all intelligent information processing systems. With the upsurge of new technology and new products in various domains, the manual construction and updating of domain knowledge base can hardly meet the real needs of application systems, in terms of coverage or effectiveness.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Based on natural language text analysis, this paper intends to draw a basic framework for the construction of domain knowledge base. Using encyclopedia resources and text information resources on the Web, we focus on the method of constructing domain knowledge base through technologies in natural language text analysis and machine learning.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Moreover, an open network platform will be developed, through which common users can work with domain experts to contribute domain knowledge.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> The technology can be applied to the construction and updating of domain knowledge base for intelligent information processing, and it can also provide help for the knowledge updating of encyclopedias.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Keywords: Domain knowledge base, Natural language text analysis, machine learning, encyclopedia, open platform</Paragraph>
