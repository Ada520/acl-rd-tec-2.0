Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present the HybridTrim system which uses a machine learning technique to combine linguistic, statistical and positional information to identify topic labels for headlines in a text. We compare our system with the Topiary system which, in contrast, uses a statistical learning approach to finding topic descriptors for headlines. The Topiary system, developed at the University of Maryland with BBN, was the top performing headline generation system at DUC 2004. Topiary-style headlines consist of a number of general topic labels followed by a compressed version of the lead sentence of a news story. The Topiary system uses a statistical learning approach to finding topic labels. The performance of these systems is evaluated using the ROUGE evaluation suite on the DUC 2004 news stories collection.</Paragraph>
