</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Ensuring consistency of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging plays an important role in constructing high-quality Chinese corpora. After analyzing the POS tagging of multi-category words in large-scale corpora, we propose a novel consistency check method of POS tagging in this paper. Our method builds a vector model of the context of multi-category words, and uses the CZ-NN algorithm to classify context vectors constructed from POS tagging sequences and judge their consistency. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is feasible and effective.</Paragraph>
