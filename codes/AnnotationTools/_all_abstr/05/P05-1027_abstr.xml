<Paragraph position="0"> This paper regards Question Answering (QA) as Question-Biased Term Extraction (QBTE). This new QBTE approach liberates QA systems from the heavy burden imposed by question types (or answer types). In conventional approaches, a QA system analyzes a given question and determines the question type, and then it selects answers from among answer candidates that match the question type. Consequently, the output of a QA system is restricted by the design of the question types. The QBTE directly extracts answers as terms biased by the question. To con rm the feasibility of our QBTE approach, we conducted experiments on the CRL QA Data based on 10-fold cross validation, using Maximum Entropy Models (MEMs) as an ML technique. Experimental results showed that the trained system achieved 0.36 in MRR and 0.47 in Top5 accuracy.</Paragraph>
