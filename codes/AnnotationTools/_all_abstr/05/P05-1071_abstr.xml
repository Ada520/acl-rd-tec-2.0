Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach to using a morphological analyzer for tokenizing and morphologically tagging (including part-of-speech tagging) Arabic words in one process. We learn classifiers for individual morphological features, as well as ways of using these classifiers to choose among entries from the output of the analyzer. We obtain accuracy rates on all tasks in the high nineties.</Paragraph>
