Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of local coherence. We present a novel entity-based representation of discourse which is inspired by Centering Theory and can be computed automatically from raw text. We view coherence assessment as a ranking learning problem and show that the proposed discourse representation supports the effective learning of a ranking function. Our experiments demonstrate that the induced model achieves significantly higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art coherence model.</Paragraph>
