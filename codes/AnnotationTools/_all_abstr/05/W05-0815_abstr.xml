Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present some experiments conducted within the context of one of the shared tasks of the ACL 2005 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts. We have employed a new model for finding the alignments. This new model takes a recursive approach in order to find the alignments. As its computational costs are quite high, a method for splitting the training sentences in smaller parts is used.</Paragraph>
