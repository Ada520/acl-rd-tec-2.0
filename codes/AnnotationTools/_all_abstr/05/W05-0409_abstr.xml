Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we study how to generate features from various data representations, such as surface texts and parse trees, for answer extraction. Besides the features generated from the surface texts, we mainly discuss the feature generation in the parse trees. We propose and compare three methods, including feature vector, string kernel and tree kernel, to represent the syntactic features in Support Vector Machines. The experiment on the TREC question answering task shows that the features generated from the more structured data representations significantly improve the performance based on the features generated from the surface texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Furthermore, the contribution of the individual feature will be discussed in detail.</Paragraph>
