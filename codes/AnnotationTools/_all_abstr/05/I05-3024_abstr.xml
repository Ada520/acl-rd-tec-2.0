Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a data-driven language independent word segmentation system that has been trained for Chinese corpus at the second Chinese word segmentation bakeoff.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The system consists of a base segmentation algorithm and the refining procedures for the undecided character sequences. It does not use any lexicon and the base segmentation is simply done by character bigram and HMM-model is applied for the remaining character sequences. As a final step, high-frequency character trigram modifies the error-prone parts of the text.T1T</Paragraph>
