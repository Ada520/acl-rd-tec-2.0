Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a new sentence realization framework for text-to-text applications.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This framework uses IDL-expressions as a representation formalism, and a generation mechanism based on algorithms for intersecting IDL-expressions with probabilistic language models. We present both theoretical and empirical results concerning the correctness and efficiency of these algorithms.</Paragraph>
