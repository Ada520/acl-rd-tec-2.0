Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a novel approach to statistical machine translation that combines syntactic information in the source language with recent advances in phrasal translation. This method requires a source-language dependency parser, target language word segmentation and an unsupervised word alignment component.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We align a parallel corpus, project the source dependency parse onto the target sentence, extract dependency treelet translation pairs, and train a tree-based ordering model. We describe an efficient decoder and show that using these tree-based models in combination with conventional SMT models provides a promising approach that incorporates the power of phrasal SMT with the linguistic generality available in a parser.</Paragraph>
