Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this work we present a method for Named Entity Recognition (NER). Our method does not rely on complex linguistic resources, and apart from a hand coded system, we do not use any language-dependent tools. The only information we use is automatically extracted from the documents, without human intervention.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Moreover, the method performs well even without the use of the hand coded system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The experimental results are very encouraging. Our approach even outperformed the hand coded system on NER in Spanish, and it achieved high accuracies in Portuguese. null</Paragraph>
