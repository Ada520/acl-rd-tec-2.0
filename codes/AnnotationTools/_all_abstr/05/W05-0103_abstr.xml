Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the creation of Language and Computers, a new course at the Ohio State University designed to be a broad overview of topics in computational linguistics, focusing on applications which have the most immediate relevance to students. This course satisfies the mathematical and logical analysis requirement at Ohio State by using natural language systems to motivate students to exercise and develop a range of basic skills in formal and computational analysis. In this paper we discuss the design of the course, focusing on the success we have had in offering it, as well as some of the difficulties we have faced.</Paragraph>
