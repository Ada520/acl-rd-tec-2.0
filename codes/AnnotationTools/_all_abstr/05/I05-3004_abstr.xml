Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In Chinese, nouns need numeral classifiers to express quantity. In this paper, we explore the relationship between classifiers and nouns. We extract a set of lexical, syntactic and ontological features and the corresponding noun-classifier pairs from a corpus and then train SVMs to assign classifers to nouns. We analyse which features are most important for this task.</Paragraph>
