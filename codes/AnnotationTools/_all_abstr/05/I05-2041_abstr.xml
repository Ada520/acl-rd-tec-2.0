</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we propose a tree annotation tool using a parser in order to build a treebank. For the purpose of minimizing manual effort without any modification of the parser, it performs two-phase parsing for the intra-structure of each segment and the inter-structure after segmenting a sentence. Experimental results show that it can reduce manual effort about 24.5% as compared with a tree annotation tool without segmentation because an annotation's intervention related to cancellation and reconstruction remarkably decrease although it requires the annotator to segment some long sentence.</Paragraph>
