Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes Acorn, a sentence planner and surface realizer for dialogue systems. Improvements to previous stochastic word-forest based approaches are described, countering recent criticism of this class of algorithms for their slow speed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> An evaluation of the approach with semantic input shows runtimes of a fraction of a second and presents results that suggest it is also portable across domains.</Paragraph>
