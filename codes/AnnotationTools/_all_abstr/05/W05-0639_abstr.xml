</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a system for the CoNLL-2005 Shared Task on Semantic Role Labeling. We trained two parsers with the training corpus in which the semantic argument information is attached to the constituent labels, we then used the resulting parse trees as the input of the pipelined SRL system. We present our results of combining the output of various SRL systems using different parsers.</Paragraph>
