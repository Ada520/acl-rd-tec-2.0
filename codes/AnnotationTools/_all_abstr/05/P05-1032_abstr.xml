Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe a novel data structure for phrase-based statistical machine translation which allows for the retrieval of arbitrarily long phrases while simultaneously using less memory than is required by current decoder implementations. We detail the computational complexity and average retrieval times for looking up phrase translations in our suffix array-based data structure. We show how sampling can be used to reduce the retrieval time by orders of magnitude with no loss in translation quality.</Paragraph>
