Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Instructional texts consist of sequences of instructions designed in order to reach an objective. The author or the generator of instructional texts must follow a number of principles to guarantee that the text is of any use. Similarly, a user must follow step by step the instructions in order to reach the results expected. In this paper, we explore facets of instructional texts: general prototypical structures, rhetorical structure and natural argumentation. Our study is based on an extensive corpus study with the aim of generating such texts.</Paragraph>
