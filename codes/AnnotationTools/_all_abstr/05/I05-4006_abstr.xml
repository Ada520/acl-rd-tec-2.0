<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the structural annotation of a spoken dialogue corpus.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> By statistically dealing with the corpus, the automatic acquisition of dialogue-structural rules is achieved. The dialogue structure is expressed as a binary tree and 789 dialogues consisting of 8150 utterances in the CIAIR speech corpus are annotated. To evaluate the scalability of the corpus for creating dialogue-structural rules, a dialogue parsing experiment was conducted. null</Paragraph>
