</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a hybrid model for restoring an elided entry word for encyclopedia QA system. In Korean encyclopedia, an entry word is frequently omitted in a sentence. If the QA system uses a sentence without an entry word, it cannot provide a right answer. For resolving this problem, we combine a rule-based approach with Maximum Entropy model to use the merit of each approach. A rule-based approach uses caseframes and sense classes. The result shows that combined approach gives a 20% increase over our baseline.</Paragraph>
