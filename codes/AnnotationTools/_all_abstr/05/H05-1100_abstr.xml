Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present two methods for incorporating detailed features in a Spanish parser, building on a baseline model that is a lexicalized PCFG. The first method exploits Spanish morphology, and achieves an F1 constituency score of 83.6%. This is an improvement over 81.2% accuracy for the baseline, which makes little or no use of morphological information. The second model uses a reranking approach to add arbitrary global features of parse trees to the morphological model. The reranking model reaches 85.1% F1 accuracy on the Spanish parsing task. The resulting model for Spanish parsing combines an approach that specifically targets morphological information with an approach that makes use of general structural features.</Paragraph>
