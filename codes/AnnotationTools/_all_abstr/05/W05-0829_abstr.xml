Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This article describes the competitive grouping algorithm at the core of our Integrated Segmentation and Alignment (ISA) model. ISA extracts phrase pairs from a bilingual corpus without requiring the pre-calculated word alignment as many other phrase alignment models do. Experiments conducted within the WPT-05 shared task on statistical machine translation demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of this approach.</Paragraph>
