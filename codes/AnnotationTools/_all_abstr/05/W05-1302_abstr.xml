Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present the evaluation of a set of string similarity metrics used to resolve the mapping from strings to concepts in the UMLS MetaThesaurus.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> String similarity is conceived as a single component in a full Reference Resolution System that would resolve such a mapping. Given this qualification, we obtain positive results achieving 73.6 F-measure (76.1 precision and 71.4 recall) for the task of assigning the correct UMLS concept to a given string. Our results demonstrate that adaptive string similarity methods based on Conditional Random Fields outperform standard metrics in this domain. null</Paragraph>
