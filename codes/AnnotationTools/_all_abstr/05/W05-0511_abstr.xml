Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> I describe steps toward &amp;quot;deep lexical acquisition&amp;quot; based on naive theories, motivated by modern results of developmental psychology. I argue that today's machine learning paradigm is inappropriate to take these steps. Instead we must develop computational accounts of naive theory representations, mechanisms of theory acquisition, and the mapping of naive theories to lexicalizable concepts. This will enable our theories to describe the flexibility of the human conceptual apparatus.</Paragraph>
