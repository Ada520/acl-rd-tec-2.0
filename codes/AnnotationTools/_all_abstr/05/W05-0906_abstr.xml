<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses the convergence between question answering and multi-document summarization, pointing out implications and opportunities for knowledge transfer in both directions. As a case study in one direction, we discuss the recent development of an automatic method for evaluating definition questions based on n-gram overlap, a commonly-used technique in summarization evaluation. In the other direction, the move towards topic-oriented summaries requires an understanding of relevance and topicality, issues which have received attention in the question answering literature. It is our opinion that question answering and multi-document summarization representtwocomplementaryapproachestothe null same problem of satisfying complex user information needs. Although this points to many exciting opportunities for systembuilding, here we primarily focus on implications for system evaluation.</Paragraph>
