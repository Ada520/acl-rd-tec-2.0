Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an NLG system that uses Integer Linear Programming to integrate different decisions involved in the generation process. Our approach provides an alternative to pipeline-based sequential processing which has become prevalent in today's NLG applications.</Paragraph>
