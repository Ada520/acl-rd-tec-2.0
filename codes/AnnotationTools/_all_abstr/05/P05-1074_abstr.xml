Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Previous work has used monolingual parallel corpora to extract and generate paraphrases. We show that this task can be done using bilingual parallel corpora, a much more commonly available resource.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Using alignment techniques from phrase-based statistical machine translation, we show how paraphrases in one language can be identified using a phrase in another language as a pivot. We define a paraphrase probability that allows paraphrases extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus to be ranked using translation probabilities, and show how it can be refined to take contextual information into account.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We evaluate our paraphrase extraction and ranking methods using a set of manual word alignments, and contrast the quality with paraphrases extracted from automatic alignments.</Paragraph>
