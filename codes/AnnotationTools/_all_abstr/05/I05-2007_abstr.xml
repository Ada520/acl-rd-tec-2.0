Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a resource-based method of morphological annotation of written Korean text. Korean is an agglutinative language. The output of our system is a graph of morphemes annotated with accurate linguistic information. The language resources used by the system can be easily updated, which allows users to control the evolution of the performances of the system. We show that morphological annotation of Korean text can be performed directly with a lexicon of words and without morphological rules.</Paragraph>
