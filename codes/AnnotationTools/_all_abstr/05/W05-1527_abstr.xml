Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe SUPPLE, a freely-available, open source natural language parsing system, implemented in Prolog, and designed for practical use in language engineering (LE) applications. SUPPLE can be run as a stand-alone application, or as a component within the GATE General Architecture for Text Engineering. SUPPLE is distributed with an example grammar that has been developed over a number of years across several LE projects. This paper describes the key characteristics of the parser and the distributed grammar.</Paragraph>
