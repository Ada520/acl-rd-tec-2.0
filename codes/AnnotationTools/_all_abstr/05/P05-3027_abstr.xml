Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> SenseClusters is a freely available system that identifies similar contexts in text. It relies on lexical features to build first and second order representations of contexts, which are then clustered using unsupervised methods. It was originally developed to discriminate among contexts centered around a given target word, but can now be applied more generally. It also supports methods that create descriptive and discriminating labels for the discovered clusters.</Paragraph>
