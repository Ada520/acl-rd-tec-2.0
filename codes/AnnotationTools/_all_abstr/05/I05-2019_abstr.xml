Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks) play an important role in recent statistical natural language processing. However, building a large tree-bank is labor intensive and time consuming work. To remedy this problem, there have been many attempts to develop software tools for annotating treebanks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper presents an integrated environment for annotating a treebank, called eBonsai. eBonsai helps annotators to choose a correct syntactic structure of a sentence from outputs of a parser, allowing the annotators to retrieve similar sentences in the treebank for referring to their structures.</Paragraph>
