</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> German has a productive morphology and allows the creation of complex words which are often highly ambiguous. This paper reports on the development of a head-lexicalized PCFG for the disambiguation of German morphological analyses. The grammar is trained on unlabeled data using the Inside-Outside algorithm. The parser achieves a precision of more than 68% on difficult test data, which is 23% more than the baseline obtained by randomly choosing one of the simplest analyses. Remarkable is the fact that precision drops to 52% without lexicalization. null</Paragraph>
