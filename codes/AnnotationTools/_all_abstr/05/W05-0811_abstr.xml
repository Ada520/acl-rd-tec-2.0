</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a set of techniques for bitext word alignment, optimized for a language pair with the characteristics of Inuktitut-English. The resulting systems exploit cross-lingual af nities at the sublexical level of syllables and substrings, as well as regular patterns of transliteration and the tendency towards monotonicity of alignment. Our most successful systems were based on classi er combination, and we found different combination methods performed best under the target evaluation metrics of F-measure and alignment error rate.</Paragraph>
