Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Statistical machine translation systems use a combination of one or more translation models and a language model. While there is a significant body of research addressing the improvement of translation models, the problem of optimizing language models for a specific translation task has not received much attention. Typically, standard word trigram models are used as an out-of-the-box component in a statistical machine translation system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper we apply language modeling techniques that have proved beneficial in automatic speech recognition to the ACL05 machine translation shared data task and demonstrate improvements over a baseline system with a standard language model.</Paragraph>
