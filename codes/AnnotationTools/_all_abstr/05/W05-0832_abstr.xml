Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Translation memories provide assistance to human translators in production settings, and are sometimes used as first-pass machine translation in assimilation settings because they produce highly fluent output very rapidly.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, we describe and evaluate a simple whole-segment translation memory, placing it as a new lower bound in the well-populated space of machine translation systems. The result is a new way to gauge how far machine translation has progressed compared to an easily understood baseline system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The evaluation also sheds light on the evaluation metric and gives evidence showing that gaming translation with perfect fluency does not fool bleu the way it fools people.</Paragraph>
