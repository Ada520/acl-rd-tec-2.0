Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce a learning semantic parser, SCISSOR, that maps natural-language sentences to a detailed, formal, meaning-representation language. It first uses an integrated statistical parser to produce a semantically augmented parse tree, in which each non-terminal node has both a syntactic and a semantic label.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A compositional-semantics procedure is then used to map the augmented parse tree into a final meaning representation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We evaluate the system in two domains, a natural-language database interface and an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer. We present experimental results demonstrating that SCISSOR produces more accurate semantic representations than several previous approaches.</Paragraph>
