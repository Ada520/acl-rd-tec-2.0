Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a version of Inversion Transduction Grammar where rule probabilities are lexicalized throughout the synchronous parse tree, along with pruning techniques for efficient training. Alignment results improve over unlexicalized ITG on short sentences for which full EM is feasible, but pruning seems to have a negative impact on longer sentences.</Paragraph>
