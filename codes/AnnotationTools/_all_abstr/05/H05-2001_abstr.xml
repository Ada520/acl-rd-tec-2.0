<Paragraph position="0"> A modular architecture promotes flexibility (ease of adaptation to new domains, client requirements and language pairs) and extensibility (incorporation of new error-detector components as they become available).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In a transparent preprocessing stage, source and target texts are read and aligned. The resulting stream of alignment regions is passed to a set of independent error-detection modules, each of which records errors in a global table for subsequent report generation. Certain of the error-detection components make use of external data in the form of lexical and other language resources.</Paragraph>
