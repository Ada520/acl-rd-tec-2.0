Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an application of Sparse Bayesian Learning to the task of semantic role labeling, and we demonstrate that this method produces smaller classifiers than the popular Support Vector approach.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We describe the classification strategy and the features used by the classifier. In particular, the contribution of six parse tree path features is investigated.</Paragraph>
