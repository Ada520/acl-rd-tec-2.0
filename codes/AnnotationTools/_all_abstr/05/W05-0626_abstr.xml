Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a system for semantic role labeling for the CoNLL2005 Shared task. We divide the task into two sub-tasks: boundary recognition by a general tree-based predicate-argument recognition algorithm to convert a parse tree into a flat representation of all predicates and their related boundaries, and role labeling by a consensus model using a pattern-matching framework to find suitable roles for core constituents and adjuncts. We describe the system architecture and report results for the CoNLL2005 development dataset.</Paragraph>
