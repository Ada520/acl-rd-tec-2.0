Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) lexicon from a Turkish dependency treebank. The fact that Turkish is an agglutinating free word-order language presents a challenge for language theories. We explored possible ways to obtain a compact lexicon, consistent with CCG principles, from a treebank which is an order of magnitude smaller than Penn WSJ.</Paragraph>
