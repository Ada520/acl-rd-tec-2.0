Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a range of deep lexical acquisition methods which make use of morphological, syntactic and ontological language resources to model word similarity and bootstrap from a seed lexicon. The different methods are deployed in learning lexical items for a precision grammar, and shown to each have strengths and weaknesses over different word classes. A particular focus of this paper is the relative accessibility of different language resource types, and predicted &amp;quot;bang for the buck&amp;quot; associated with each in deep lexical acquisition applications.</Paragraph>
