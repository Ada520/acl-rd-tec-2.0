</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a new method for reformatting web documents by extracting semantic structures from web pages. Our approach is to extract trees that describe hierarchical relations in documents. We developed an algorithm for this task by employing the EM algorithm and clustering techniques. Preliminary experiments showed that our approach was more effective than baseline methods.</Paragraph>
