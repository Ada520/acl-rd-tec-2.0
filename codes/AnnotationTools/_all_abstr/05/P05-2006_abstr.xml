Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Semantic relations between text concepts denote the core elements of lexical semantics. This paper presents a model for the automatic detection of INTENTION semantic relation. Our approach first identifies the syntactic patterns that encode intentions, then we select syntactic and semantic features for a SVM learning classifier. In conclusion, we discuss the application of INTENTION relations to Q&amp;A.</Paragraph>
