</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> present a noisy-channel model for sentence compression. The main difficulty in using this method is the lack of data; Knight and Marcu use a corpus of 1035 training sentences. More data is not easily available, so in addition to improving the original K&amp;M noisy-channel model, we create unsupervised and semi-supervised models of the task. Finally, we point out problems with modeling the task in this way. They suggest areas for future research. null</Paragraph>
