Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce improvements to statistical word alignment based on the Hidden Markov Model. One improvement incorporates syntactic knowledge. Results on the workshop data show that alignment performance exceeds that of a state-of-the art system based on more complex models, resulting in over a 5.5% absolute reduction in error on Romanian-English.</Paragraph>
