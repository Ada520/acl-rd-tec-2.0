</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a semantic class prediction model of Chinese two-character compound words based on a character ontology, which is set to be a feasible conceptual knowledge resource grounded in Chinese characters. The experiment we conduct yields satisfactory results which turn out to be that the task of semantic prediction of two-character words could be greatly facilitated using Chinese characters as a knowledge resource.</Paragraph>
