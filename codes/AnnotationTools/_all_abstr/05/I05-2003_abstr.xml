<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a hybrid Chinese language model based on a combination of ontology with statistical method. In this study, we determined the structure of such a Chinese language model. This structure is firstly comprised of an ontology description framework for Chinese words and a representation of Chinese lingual ontology knowledge. Subsequently, a Chinese lingual ontology knowledge bank is automatically acquired by determining, for each word, its co-occurrence with semantic, pragmatics, and syntactic information from the training corpus and the usage of Chinese words will be gotten from lingual ontology knowledge bank for a actual document. To evaluate the performance of this language model, we completed two groups of experiments on texts re-ordering for Chinese information retrieval and texts similarity computing.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Compared with previous works, the proposed method improved the precision of nature language processing.</Paragraph>
