<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a method for identifying systematic patterns in translation data using part-of-speech tag sequences. We incorporate this analysis into a diagnostic tool intended for developers of machine translation systems, and demonstrate how our application can be used by developers to explore patterns in machine translation output.</Paragraph>
