Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce a method for transferring annotation from a syntactically annotated corpus in a source language to a target language. Our approach assumes only that an (unannotated) text corpus exists for the target language, and does not require that the parameters of the mapping between the two languages are known. We outline a general probabilistic approach based on Data Augmentation, discuss the algorithmic challenges, and present a novel algorithm for sampling from a posterior distribution over trees.</Paragraph>
