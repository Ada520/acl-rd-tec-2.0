<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a status quo of an ongoing research study of collocations an essential linguistic phenomenon having a wide spectrum of applications in the field of natural language processing.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The core of the work is an empirical evaluation of a comprehensive list of automatic collocation extraction methods using precision-recall measures and a proposal of a new approach integrating multiple basic methods and statistical classification. We demonstrate that combining multiple independent techniques leads to a significant performance improvement in comparisonwith individualbasic methods.</Paragraph>
