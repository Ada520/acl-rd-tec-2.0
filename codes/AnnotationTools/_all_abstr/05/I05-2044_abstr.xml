Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In the Chinese language, a verb may have its dependents on its left, right or on both sides. The ambiguity resolution of right-side dependencies is essential for dependency parsing of sentences with two or more verbs. Previous works on shift-reduce dependency parsers may not guarantee the connectivity of a dependency tree due to their weakness at resolving the right-side dependencies. This paper proposes a two-phase shift-reduce dependency parser based on SVM learning. The left-side dependents and right-side nominal dependents are detected in Phase I, and right-side verbal dependents are decided in Phase II. In experimental evaluation, our proposed method outperforms previous shift-reduce dependency parsers for the Chine language, showing improvement of dependency accuracy by 10.08%.</Paragraph>
