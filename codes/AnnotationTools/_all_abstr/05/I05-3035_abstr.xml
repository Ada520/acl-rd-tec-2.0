Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a Chinese word segmentation system which is consisted of four components, i.e. basic segmentation, named entity recognition, error-driven learner and new word detector. The basic segmentation and named entity recognition, implemented based on conditional random fields, are used to generate initial segmentation results. The other two components are used to refine the results.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our system participated in the tests on open and closed tracks of Beijing University (PKU) and Microsoft Research (MSR). The actual evaluation results show that our system performs very well in MSR open track, MSR closed track and PKU open track.</Paragraph>
