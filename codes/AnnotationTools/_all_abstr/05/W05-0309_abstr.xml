Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The Proposition Bank (PropBank) project is aimed at creating a corpus of text annotated with information about semantic propositions. The second phase of the project, PropBank II adds additional levels of semantic annotation which include eventuality variables, co-reference, coarse-grained sense tags, and discourse connectives. This paper presents the results of the parallel PropBank II project, which adds these richer layers of semantic annotation to the first 100K of the Chinese Treebank and its English translation. Our preliminary analysis supports the hypothesis that this additional annotation reconciles many of the surface differences between the two languages.</Paragraph>
