Abstract
In Online Inquiry-Based Learning (OIBL)
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> learners search for information to answer driving questions. While learners conduct sequential related searches, the search engines interpret each query in isolation, and thus are unable to utilize task context.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Consequently, learners usually get less relevant search results. We are developing a NLP-based search agent to bridge the gap between learners and search engines.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Our algorithms utilize contextual features to provide user with search term suggestions and results re-ranking. Our pilot study indicates that our method can effectively enhance the quality of OIBL.</Paragraph>
