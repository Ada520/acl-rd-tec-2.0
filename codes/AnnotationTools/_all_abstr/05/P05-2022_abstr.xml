Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a word and phrase alignment approach based on a dependency analysis of French/English parallel corpora, referred to as alignment by &amp;quot;syntax-based propagation.&amp;quot; Both corpora are analysed with a deep and robust dependency parser. Starting with an anchor pair consisting of two words that are translations of one another within aligned sentences, the alignment link is propagated to syntactically connected words.</Paragraph>
