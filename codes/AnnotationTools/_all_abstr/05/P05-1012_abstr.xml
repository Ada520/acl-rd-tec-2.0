Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an effective training algorithm for linearly-scored dependency parsers that implements online large-margin multi-class training (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2003) on top of efficient parsing techniques for dependency trees (Eisner, 1996). The trained parsers achieve a competitive dependency accuracy for both English and Czech with no language specific enhancements.</Paragraph>
