Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The annotations of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) include (1) discourse connectives and their arguments, and (2) attribution of each argument of each connective and of the relation it denotes. Because the PDTB covers the same text as the Penn TreeBank WSJ corpus, syntactic and discourse annotation can be compared. This has revealed significant differences between syntactic structure and discourse structure, in terms of the arguments of connectives, due in large part to attribution. We describe these differences, an algorithm for detecting them, and finally some experimental results. These results have implications for automating discourse annotation based on syntactic annotation. null</Paragraph>
