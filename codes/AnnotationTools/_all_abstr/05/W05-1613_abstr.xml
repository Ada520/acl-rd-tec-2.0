Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> It is hard to come up with a general formalisation of the problem of content determination in natural language generation because of the degree of domaindependence that is involved. This paper presents a novel way of looking at a class of content determination problems in terms of a non-standard kind of inference, which we call natural language directed inference. This is illustrated through examples from a system under development to present parts of ontologies in natural language. Natural language directed inference represents an interesting challenge to research in automated reasoning and natural language processing.</Paragraph>
