Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Preservation of an endangered language is an important and difficult task. The preservation project should include documentation, archiving and development of shared resources for the endangered language. In addition, the project will consider how to revitalize this endangered language among the younger generation. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that will connect the three different tasks: language archiving, language processing and creating learning materials. We are using this framework to document one Taiwanese aboriginal language: Yami. The proposed framework should be an effective tool for documenting other endangered languages in Asia.</Paragraph>
