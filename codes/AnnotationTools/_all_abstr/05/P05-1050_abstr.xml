Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a supervised Word Sense Disambiguation methodology, that exploits kernel methods to model sense distinctions. In particular a combination of kernel functions is adopted to estimate independently both syntagmatic and domain similarity. We de ned a kernel function, namely the Domain Kernel, that allowed us to plug external knowledge into the supervised learning process. External knowledge is acquired from unlabeled data in a totally unsupervised way, and it is represented by means of Domain Models. We evaluated our methodology on several lexical sample tasks in different languages, outperforming signi cantly the state-of-the-art for each of them, while reducing the amount of labeled training data required for learning.</Paragraph>
