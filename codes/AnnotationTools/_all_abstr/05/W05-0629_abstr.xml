</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe our systems for the CoNLL-2005 shared task. The aim of the task is semantic role labeling using a machine-learning algorithm. We apply the Support Vector Machines to the task. We added new features based on full parses and manually categorized words. We also report on system performance and what effect the newly added features had.</Paragraph>
