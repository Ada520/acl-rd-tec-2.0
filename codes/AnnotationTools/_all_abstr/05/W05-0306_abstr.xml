</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We investigated of the characteristics of in-text causal relations. We designed causal relation tags. With our designed tag set, three annotators annotated 750 Japanese newspaper articles. Then, using the annotated corpus, we investigated the causal relation instances from some viewpoints. Our quantitative study shows that what amount of causal relation instances are present, where these relation instances are present, and which types of linguistic expressions are used for expressing these relation instances in text.</Paragraph>
