Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes extensions to a corpus annotation scheme for the manual annotation of attributions, as well as opinions, emotions, sentiments, speculations, evaluations and other private states in language. It discusses the scheme with respect to the &amp;quot;Pie in the Sky&amp;quot; Check List of Desirable Semantic Information for Annotation. We believe that the scheme is a good foundation for adding private state annotations to other layers of semantic meaning.</Paragraph>
