Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Instant Messaging chat sessions are real-time text-based conversations which can be analyzed using dialogue-act models.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We describe a statistical approach for modelling and detecting dialogue acts in Instant Messaging dialogue. This involved the collection of a small set of task-based dialogues and annotating them with a revised tag set. We then dealt with segmentation and synchronisation issues which do not arise in spoken dialogue.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The model we developed combines naive Bayes and dialogue-act n-grams to obtain better than 80% accuracy in our tagging experiment.</Paragraph>
