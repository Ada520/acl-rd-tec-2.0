Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we examine topic segmentation of narrative documents, which are characterized by long passages of text with few headings. We rst present results suggesting that previous topic segmentation approaches are not appropriate for narrative text. We then present a feature-based method that combines features from diverse sources as well as learned features.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Applied to narrative books and encyclopedia articles, our method shows results that are signi cantly better than previous segmentation approaches. An analysis of individual features is also provided and the bene t of generalization using outside resources is shown.</Paragraph>
