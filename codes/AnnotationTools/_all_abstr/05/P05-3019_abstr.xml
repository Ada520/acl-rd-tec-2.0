Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We have previously introduced a method of word sense disambiguation that computes the intended sense of a target word, using WordNet-based measures of semantic relatedness (Patwardhan et al., 2003). SenseRelate::TargetWord is a Perl package that implements this algorithm. The disambiguation process is carried out by selecting that sense of the target word which is most related to the context words.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Relatedness between word senses is measured using the WordNet::Similarity Perl modules.</Paragraph>
