Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The logical problem of language is grounded on arguents from poverty of positive evidence and arguments from poverty of negative evidence.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Careful analysis of child language corpora shows that, if one assumes that children learn through item-based constructions, there is an abundance of positive evidence. Arguments regarding the poverty of negative evidence can also be adressed by the mechanism of conservative item-based learning. When conservativism is abandoned, children can rely on competition, cue construction, monitoring and probabilistic identification to derive information from positive data to recover fro overgeneralization. null</Paragraph>
