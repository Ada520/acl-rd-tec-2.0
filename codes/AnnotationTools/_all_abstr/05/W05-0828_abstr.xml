Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We motivate our contribution to the shared MT task as a first step towards an integrated architecture that combines advantages of statistical and knowledge-based approaches. Translations were generated using the Pharaoh decoder with tables derived from the provided alignments for all four languages, and for three of them using web-based and locally installed commercial systems. We then applied statistical and heuristic algorithms to select the most promising translation out of each set of candidates obtained from a source sentence. Results and possible refinements are discussed.</Paragraph>
