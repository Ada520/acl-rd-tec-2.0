Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper evaluates a series of freely available, state-of-the-art parsers on a standard benchmark as well as with respect to a set of data relevant for measuring text cohesion. We outline advantages and disadvantages of existing technologies and make recommendations. Our performance report uses traditional measures based on a gold standard as well as novel dimensions for parsing evaluation. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to evaluate parsers accross genres and grade levels for the implementation in learning technology.</Paragraph>
