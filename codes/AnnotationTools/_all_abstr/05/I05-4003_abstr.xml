Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The acquisition of grammar from a corpus is a challenging task in the preparation of a knowledge bank. In this paper, we discuss the extraction of Chinese grammar oriented to a restricted corpus. First, probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) are extracted automatically from the Penn Chinese Treebank and are regarded as the baseline rules. Then a corpus-oriented grammar is developed by adding specific information including head information from the restricted corpus.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Then, we describe the peculiarities and ambiguities, particularly between the phrases &amp;quot;PP&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;VP&amp;quot; in the extracted grammar. Finally, the parsing results of the utterances are used to evaluate the extracted grammar.</Paragraph>
