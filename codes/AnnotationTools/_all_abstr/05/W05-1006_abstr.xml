Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a technique for extracting idioms from text. The technique works by finding patterns such as &amp;quot;thrills and spills&amp;quot;, whose reversals (such as &amp;quot;spills and thrills&amp;quot;) are never encountered. null This method collects not only idioms, but also many phrases that exhibit a strong tendency to occur in one particular order, due apparently to underlying semantic issues. These include hierarchical relationships, gender differences, temporal ordering, and prototype-variant effects.</Paragraph>
