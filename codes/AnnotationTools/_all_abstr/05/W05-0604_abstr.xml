Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Recent work on the problem of detecting synonymy through corpus analysis has used the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) as a benchmark. However, this test involves as few as 80 questions, prompting questions regarding the statistical significance of reported results.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We overcome this limitation by generating a TOEFL-like test using WordNet, containing thousands of questions and composed only of words occurring with sufficient corpus frequency to support sound distributional comparisons. Experiments with this test lead us to a similarity measure which significantly outperforms the best proposed to date. Analysis suggests that a strength of this measure is its relative robustness against polysemy.</Paragraph>
