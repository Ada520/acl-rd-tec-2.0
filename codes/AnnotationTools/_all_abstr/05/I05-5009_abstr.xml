Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an evaluation method employing a latent variable model for paraphrases with their contexts. We assume that the context of a sentence is indicated by a latent variable of the model as a topic and that the likelihood of each variable can be inferred. A paraphrase is evaluated for whether its sentences are used in the same context. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves almost 60% accuracy and that there is not a large performance difference between the two models. The results also revealed an upper bound of accuracy of 77% with the method when using only topic information.</Paragraph>
