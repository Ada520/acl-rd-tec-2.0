<Paragraph position="0"> This papers reports the application of the QARLA evaluation framework to the DUC 2004 testbed (tasks 2 and 5). Our experiment addresses two issues: how well QARLA evaluation measures correlate with human judgements, and what additional insights can be provided by the QARLA framework to the DUC evaluation exercises.</Paragraph>
