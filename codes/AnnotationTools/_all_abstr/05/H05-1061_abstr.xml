</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Key phrases are usually among the most information-bearing linguistic structures.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Translating them correctly will improve many natural language processing applications. We propose a new framework to mine key phrase translations from web corpora. We submit a source phrase to a search engine as a query, then expand queries by adding the translations of topic-relevant hint words from the returned snippets. We retrieve mixed-language web pages based on the expanded queries. Finally, we extract the key phrase translation from the second-round returned web page snippets with phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features. We achieve 46% phrase translation accuracy when using top 10 returned snippets, and 80% accuracy with 165 snippets. Both results are significantly better than several existing methods. null</Paragraph>
