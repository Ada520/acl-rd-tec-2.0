Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We will demonstrate the MIT Spoken Lecture Processing Server and an accompanying lecture browser that students can use to quickly locate and browse lecture segments that apply to their query.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We will show how lecturers can upload recorded lectures and companion text material to our server for automatic processing. The server automatically generates a time-aligned word transcript of the lecture which can be downloaded for use within a browser. We will also demonstrate a browser we have created which allows students to quickly locate and browse audio segments that are relevant to their query. These tools can provide students with easier access to audio (or audio/visual) lectures, hopefully improving their educational experience.</Paragraph>
