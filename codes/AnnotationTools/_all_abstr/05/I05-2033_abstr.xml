Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we will brie y survey the key results achieved so far in Hungarian POS tagging and show how classi er combination techniques can aid the POS taggers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Methods are evaluated on a manually annotated corpus containing 1.2 million words. POS tagger tests were performed on single-domain, multiple domain and cross-domain test settings, and, to improve the accuracy of the taggers, various combination rules were implemented.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The results indicate that combination schemas (like the Boosting algorithm) are promising tools which can signi cantly degrade the classication errors, and produce a more e ective tagger application.</Paragraph>
