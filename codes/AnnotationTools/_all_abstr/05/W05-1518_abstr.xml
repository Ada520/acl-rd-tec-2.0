Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper explores the possibilities of improving parsing results by combining outputs of several parsers. To some extent, we are porting the ideas of Henderson and Brill (1999) to the world of dependency structures. We differ from them in exploring context features more deeply. All our experiments were conducted on Czech but the method is language-independent. We were able to significantly improve over the best parsing result for the given setting, known so far. Moreover, our experiments show that even parsers far below the state of the art can contribute to the total improvement.</Paragraph>
