</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We adapt the &amp;quot;hook&amp;quot; trick for speeding up bilexical parsing to the decoding problem for machine translation models that are based on combining a synchronous context free grammar as the translation model with an n-gram language model. This dynamic programming technique yields lower complexity algorithms than have previously been described for an important class of translation models.</Paragraph>
