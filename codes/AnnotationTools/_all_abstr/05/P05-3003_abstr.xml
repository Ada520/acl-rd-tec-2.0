Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present the currently most efficient solver for scope underspecification; it also converts between different underspecification formalisms and counts readings. Our tool makes the practical use of large-scale grammars with (underspecified) semantic output more feasible, and can be used in grammar debugging.</Paragraph>
