Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe LIHLA, a lexical aligner which uses bilingual probabilistic lexicons generated by a freely available set of tools (NATools) and language-independent heuristics to find links between single words and multiword units in sentence-aligned parallel texts. The method has achieved an alignment error rate of 22.72% and 44.49% on English-Inuktitut and Romanian-English parallel sentences, respectively.</Paragraph>
