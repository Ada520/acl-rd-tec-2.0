Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A problem associated with current P2P (peer-to-peer) systems is that the consistency between copied contents is not guaranteed. Additionally, the limitation of full-text search capability in most of the popular P2P systems hinders the scalability of P2P-based content sharing systems. We proposed a new P2P content sharing system in which the consistency of contents in the network is maintained after updates or modifications have been made to the contents. Links to the downloaded contents are maintained on a server. As a result, the updates and modifications to the contents can be instantly detected and hence get reflected in future P2P downloads. Natural language processing including morphological analysis is performed distributedly by the P2P clients and the update of the inverted index on the server is conducted concurrently to provide an efficient full-text search. The scheme and a preliminary experimental result have been mentioned</Paragraph>
