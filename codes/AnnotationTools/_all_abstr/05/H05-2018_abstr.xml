1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> OpinionFinder is a system that performs subjectivity analysis, automatically identifying when opinions, sentiments, speculations, and other private states are present in text. Specifically, OpinionFinder aims to identify subjective sentences and to mark various aspects of the subjectivity in these sentences, including the source (holder) of the subjectivity and words that are included in phrases expressing positive or negative sentiments.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our goal with OpinionFinder is to develop a system capable of supporting other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by providing them with information about the subjectivity in documents. Of particular interest are question answering systems that focus on being able to answer opinionoriented questions, such as the following: How is Bush's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol looked upon by Japan and other US allies? How do the Chinese regard the human rights record of the United States? To answer these types of questions, a system needs to be able to identify when opinions are expressed in text and who is expressing them. Other applications that would benefit from knowledge of subjective language include systems that summarize the various viewpoints in a document or that mine product reviews. Even typical fact-oriented applications, such as information extraction, can benefit from subjectivity analysis by filtering out opinionated sentences (Riloff et al., 2005).</Paragraph>
