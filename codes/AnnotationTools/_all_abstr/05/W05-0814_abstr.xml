Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We discuss results on the shared task of Romanian-English word alignment. The baseline technique is that of symmetrizing two word alignments automatically generated using IBM Model 4. A simple vocabulary reduction technique results in an improvement in performance. We also report on a new alignment model and a new training algorithm based on alternating maximization of likelihood with minimization of error rate.</Paragraph>
