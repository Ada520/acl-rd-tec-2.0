Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Processing discourse connectives is important for tasks such as discourse parsing and generation. For these tasks, it is useful to know which connectives can signal the same coherence relations. This paper presents experiments into modelling the substitutability of discourse connectives.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It shows that substitutability effects distributional similarity. A novel variance-based function for comparing probability distributions is found to assist in predicting substitutability.</Paragraph>
