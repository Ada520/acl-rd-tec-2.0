Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a method for language independent extractive summarization that relies on iterative graph-based ranking algorithms. Through evaluations performed on a single-document summarization task for English and Portuguese, we show that the method performs equally well regardless of the language. Moreover, we show how a meta-summarizer relying on a layered application of techniques for single-document summarization can be turned into an effective method for multi-document summarization. null</Paragraph>
