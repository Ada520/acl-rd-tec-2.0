Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an implemented XML data model and a new, simplified query language for multi-level annotated corpora. The new query language involves automatic conversion of queries into the underlying, more complicated MMAXQL query language.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It supports queries for sequential and hierarchical, but also associative (e.g. coreferential) relations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The simplified query language has been designed with non-expert users in mind.</Paragraph>
