Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a general probabilistic setting that formalizes a probabilistic notion of textual entailment. We further describe a particular preliminary model for lexical-level entailment, based on document cooccurrence probabilities, which follows the general setting. The model was evaluated on two application independent datasets, suggesting the relevance of such probabilistic approaches for entailment modeling.</Paragraph>
