</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a sentence-level opinion detection system. We first define what an opinion means in our research and introduce an effective method for obtaining opinion-bearing and non-opinion-bearing words. Then we describe recognizing opinion-bearing sentences using these words We test the system on 3 different test sets: MPQA data, an internal corpus, and the TREC-2003 Novelty track data. We show that our automatic method for obtaining opinion-bearing words can be used effectively to identify opinion-bearing sentences.</Paragraph>
