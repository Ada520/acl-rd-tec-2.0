Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the participation of the Portage team at NRC Canada in the shared task  of ACL 2005 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts. We discuss Portage, a statistical phrase-based machine translation system, and present experimental results on the four language pairs of the shared task. First, we focus on the French-English task using multiple resources and techniques. Then we describe our contribution on the Finnish-English, Spanish-English and German-English language pairs using the provided data for the shared task.</Paragraph>
