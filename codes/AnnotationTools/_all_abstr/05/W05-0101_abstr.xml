Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In Fall 2004 I introduced a new course called Applied Natural Language Processing, in which students acquire an understanding of which text analysis techniques are currently feasible for practical applications. The class was intended for interdisciplinary students with a somewhat technical background. This paper describes the topics covered and the programming exercises, emphasizing which aspects were successful and which problematic, and makes recommendations for future versions of the course.</Paragraph>
