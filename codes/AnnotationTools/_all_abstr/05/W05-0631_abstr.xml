Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a system for the CoNLL2005 shared task of Semantic Role Labeling. The system implements a two-layer architecture to first identify the arguments and then to label them for each predicate.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The components are implemented as SVM classifiers using libSVM. Features were adapted and tuned for the system, including a reduced set for the identifier classifier. Experiments were conducted to find kernel parameters for the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. An algorithm was defined to combine the results of the argument labeling classifier according to the constraints of the argument labeling problem.</Paragraph>
