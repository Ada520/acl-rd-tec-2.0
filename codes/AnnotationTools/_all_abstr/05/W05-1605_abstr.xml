Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Natural language has a high paraphrastic power yet not all paraphrases are appropriate for all contexts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, we present a TAG based surface realiser which supports both the generation and the selection of paraphrases. To deal with the combinatorial explosion typical of such an NP-complete task, we introduce a number of new optimisations in a tabular, bottom-up surface realisation algorithm. We then show that one of these optimisations supports paraphrase selection.</Paragraph>
