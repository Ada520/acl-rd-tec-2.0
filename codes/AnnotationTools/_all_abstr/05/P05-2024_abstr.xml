<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports the corpus-oriented development of a wide-coverage Japanese HPSG parser. We first created an HPSG treebank from the EDR corpus by using heuristic conversion rules, and then extracted lexical entries from the treebank. The grammar developed using this method attained wide coverage that could hardly be obtained by conventional manual development. We also trained a statistical parser for the grammar on the treebank, and evaluated the parser in terms of the accuracy of semantic-role identification and dependency analysis.</Paragraph>
