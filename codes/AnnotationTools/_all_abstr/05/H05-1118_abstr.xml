Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we investigate the use of linguistic knowledge in passage retrieval as part of an open-domain question answering system. We use annotation produced by a deep syntactic dependency parser for Dutch, Alpino, to extract various kinds of linguistic features and syntactic units to be included in a multi-layer index. Similar annotation is produced for natural language questions to be answered by the system. From this we extract query terms to be sent to the enriched retrieval index.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the selection of features and syntactic units to be included in a query. This algorithm is also used to optimize further parameters such as keyword weights. The system is trained on questions from the competition on Dutch question answering within the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). We could show an improvement of about 15% in mean total reciprocal rank compared to traditional information retrieval using plain text keywords (including stemming and stop word removal). null</Paragraph>
