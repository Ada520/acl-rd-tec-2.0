Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a knowledge-based method for measuring the semanticsimilarity of texts. While there is a large body of previous work focused on finding the semantic similarity of concepts and words, the application of these word-oriented methods to text similarity has not been yet explored. In this paper, we introduce a method that combines word-to-word similarity metrics into a text-to-text metric, and we show that this method outperforms the traditional text similarity metrics based on lexical matching.</Paragraph>
