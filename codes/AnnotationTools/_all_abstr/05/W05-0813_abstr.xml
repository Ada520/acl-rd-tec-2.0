Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We recently decided to develop a new alignment algorithm for the purpose of improving our Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system's performance, since subsentential alignment is critical in locating the correct translation for a matched fragment of the input. Unlike most algorithms in the literature, this</Paragraph>

<Paragraph position="0"> (SPA) algorithm treats the source and target languages in a symmetric fashion.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this short paper, we outline our basic algorithm and some extensions for using context and positional information, and compare its alignment accuracy on the Romanian-English data for the shared task with IBM Model 4 and the reported results from the prior workshop.</Paragraph>
