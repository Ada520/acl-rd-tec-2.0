Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an Earley-style dynamic programming algorithm for parsing sentence pairs from a parallel corpus simultaneously, building up two phrase structure trees and a correspondence mapping between the nodes. The intended use of the algorithm is in bootstrapping grammars for less studied languages by using implicit grammatical information in parallel corpora. Therefore, we presuppose a given (statistical) word alignment underlying in the synchronous parsing task; this leads to a significant reduction of the parsing complexity. The theoretical complexity results are corroborated by a quantitative evaluation in which we ran an implementation of the algorithm on a suite of test sentences from the Europarl parallel corpus.</Paragraph>
