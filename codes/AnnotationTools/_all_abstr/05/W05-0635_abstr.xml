Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we introduce a semantic role labeling system constructed on top of the full syntactic analysis of text. The labeling problem is modeled using a rich set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic attributes and learned using one-versus-all AdaBoost classifiers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our results indicate that even a simple approach that assumes that each semantic argument maps into exactly one syntactic phrase obtains encouraging performance, surpassing the best system that uses partial syntax by almost 6%.</Paragraph>
