Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a unified evaluation method for multiple reading support systems such as a sentence translation system and a word translation system. In reading a non-native language text, these systems aim to lighten the reading burden. When we evaluate the performance of these systems, we cannot rely solely on these tests, as the output forms are different.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Therefore, we must assess the performance of these systems based on the users' reading comprehension and reading speed. We will further support our findings with experimental results.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> They show that the reading-speed procedure is able to evaluate the support systems, as well as, the comprehension-based procedure proposed by Ohguro (1993) and Fuji et al. (2001).</Paragraph>
