Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Our aim is to investigate computational linguistics (CL) techniques in marking short free text responses automatically. Successful automatic marking of free text answers would seem to presuppose an advanced level of performance in automated natural language understanding. However, recent advances in CL techniques have opened up the possibility of being able to automate the marking of free text responses typed into a computer without having to create systems that fully understand the answers. This paper describes some of the techniques we have tried so far vis-a-vis this problem with results, discussion and description of the main issues encountered.1</Paragraph>
