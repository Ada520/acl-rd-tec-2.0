</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper addresses the task of extracting opinions from a given document collection. Assuming that an opinion can be represented as a tuple &lt;Subject, Attribute, Value&gt; , we propose a computational method to extract such tuples from texts. In this method, the main task is decomposed into (a) the process of extracting Attribute-Value pairs from a given text and (b) the process of judging whether an extracted pair expresses an opinion of the author. We apply machine-learning techniques to both subtasks. We also report on the results of our experiments and discuss future directions.</Paragraph>
