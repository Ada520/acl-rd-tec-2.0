Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper classifies six publicly available biomedical corpora according to various corpus design features and characteristics. We then present usage data for the six corpora. We show that corpora that are carefully annotated with respect to structural and linguistic characteristics and that are distributed in standard formats are more widely used than corpora that are not. These findings have implications for the design of the next generation of biomedical corpora.</Paragraph>
