Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an unsupervised system that exploits linguistic knowledge resources, namely English and German lexical databases and the World Wide Web, to identify English inclusions in German text. We describe experiments with this system and the corpus which was developed for this task. We report the classification results of our system and compare them to the performance of a trained machine learner in a series of in- and cross-domain experiments.</Paragraph>
