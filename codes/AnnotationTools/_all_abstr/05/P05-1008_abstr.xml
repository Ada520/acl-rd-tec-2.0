Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a new approach to controlling the behaviour of a natural language generation system by correlating internal decisions taken during free generation of a wide range of texts with the surface stylistic characteristics of the resulting outputs, and using the correlation to control the generator. This contrasts with the generate-and-test architecture adopted by most previous empirically-based generation approaches, offering a more efficient, generic and holistic method of generator control. We illustrate the approach by describing a system in which stylistic variation (in the sense of Biber (1988)) can be effectively controlled during the generation of short medical information texts.</Paragraph>
