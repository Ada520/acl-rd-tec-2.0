Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a framework for generating locative expressions. The framework addresses the issue of combinatorial explosion inherent in the construction of relational context models by: (a) contextually defining the set of objects in the context that may function as a landmark, and (b) sequencing the order in which spatial relations are considered using a cognitively motivated hierarchy of relations.</Paragraph>
