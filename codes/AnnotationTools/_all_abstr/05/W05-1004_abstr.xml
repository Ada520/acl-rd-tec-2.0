Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Qualia Structures have many applications within computational linguistics, but currently there are no corresponding lexical resources such as WordNet or FrameNet. This paper presents an approach to automatically learn qualia structures for nominals from the World Wide Web and thus opens the possibility to explore the impact of qualia structures for natural language processing at a larger scale. Furthermore, our approach can be also used support a lexicographer in the task of manually creating a lexicon of qualia structures. The approach is based on the idea of matching certain lexico-syntactic patterns conveying a certain semantic relation on the World Wide Web using standard search engines. We evaluate our approach qualitatively by comparing our automatically learned qualia structures with the ones from the literature, but also quantitatively by presenting results of a human evaluation.</Paragraph>
