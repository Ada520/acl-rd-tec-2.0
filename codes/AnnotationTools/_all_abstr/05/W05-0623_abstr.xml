Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a semantic role labeling system submitted to the closed track of the CoNLL-2005 shared task. The system, introduced in (Toutanova et al., 2005), implements a joint model that captures dependencies among arguments of a predicate using log-linear models in a discriminative re-ranking framework. We also describe experiments aimed at increasing the robustness of the system in the presence of syntactic parse errors. Our final system achieves F1-Measures of 76.68 and 78.45 on the development and the WSJ portion of the test set, respectively.</Paragraph>
