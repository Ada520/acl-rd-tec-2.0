Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we proposed an approach for detecting the countability of English compound nouns treating the web as a large corpus of words. We classified compound nouns into three classes: countable, uncountable, plural only.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our detecting algorithm is based on simple, viable n-gram models, whose parameters can be obtained using the WWW search engine Google. The detecting thresholds are optimized on the small training set. Finally we experimentally showed that our algorithm based on these simple models could perform the promising results with a precision of 89.2% on the total test set.</Paragraph>
