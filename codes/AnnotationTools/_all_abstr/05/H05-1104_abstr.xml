Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Experimental research in psycholinguistics has demonstrated a parallelism effect in coordination: speakers are faster at processing the second conjunct of a coordinate structure if it has the same internal structure as the first conjunct. We show that this phenomenon can be explained by the prevalence of parallel structures in corpus data. We demonstrate that parallelism is not limited to coordination, but also applies to arbitrary syntactic configurations, and even to documents. This indicates that the parallelism effect is an instance of a general syntactic priming mechanism in human language processing.</Paragraph>
