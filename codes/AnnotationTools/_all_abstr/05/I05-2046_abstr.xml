Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Current NER approaches include: dictionary-based, rule-based, or machine learning. Since there is no consolidated nomenclature for most biomedical NEs, most NER systems relying on limited dictionaries or rules do not perform satisfactorily. In this paper, we apply Maximum Entropy (ME) to construct our NER framework.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We represent shallow linguistic information as linguistic features in our ME model. On the GENIA 3.02 corpus, our system achieves satisfactory F-scores of 74.3% in protein and 70.0% overall without using any dictionary. Our system performs significantly better than dictionary-based systems. Using partial match criteria, our system achieves an F-score of 81.3%. Using appropriate domain knowledge to modify the boundaries, our system has the potential to achieve an F-score of over 80%.</Paragraph>
