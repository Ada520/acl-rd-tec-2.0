Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> By combining multiple clauses into one single sentence, a text generation system can express the same amount of information in fewer words and at the same time, produce a great variety of complex constructions. In this paper, we describe hypotactic and paratactic operators for generating complex sentences from clause-sized semantic representations. These two types of operators are portable and reusable because they are based on general resources such as the lexicon and the grammar.</Paragraph>
