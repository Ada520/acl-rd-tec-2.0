Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> To segment texts in thematic units, we present here how a basic principle relying on word distribution can be applied on different kind of texts. We start from an existing method well adapted for scientific texts, and we propose its adaptation to other kinds of texts by using semantic links between words. These relations are found in a lexical network, automatically built from a large corpus. We will compare their results and give criteria to choose the more suitable method according to text characteristics.</Paragraph>
