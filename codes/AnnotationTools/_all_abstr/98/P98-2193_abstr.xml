</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper studies and evaluates disambiguation strategies for the translation of tense between German and English, using a bilingual corpus of appointment scheduling dialogues. It describes a scheme to detect complex verb predicates based on verb form subcategorization and grammatical knowledge. The extracted verb and tense information is presented and the role of different context factors is discussed.</Paragraph>
