Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes how to construct a finite-state machine (FSM) approximating a 'unification-based' grammar using a left-corner grammar transform.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The approximation is presented as a series of grammar transforms, and is exact for left-linear and right-linear CFGs, and for trees up to a user-specified depth of center-embedding.</Paragraph>
