Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Bootstrapping semantics from text is one of the greatest challenges in natural language learning.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We first define a word similarity measure based on the distributional pattern of words. The similarity measure allows us to construct a thesaurus using a parsed corpus. We then present a new evaluation methodology for the automatically constructed thesaurus. The evaluation results show that the thesaurns is significantly closer to WordNet than Roget Thesaurus is.</Paragraph>
