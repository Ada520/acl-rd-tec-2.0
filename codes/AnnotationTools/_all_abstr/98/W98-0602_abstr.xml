Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The interpretation of nominalized expressions in English poses several problems. First, it must be explained how their meanings are derived from the meanings of the underlying verbs. Second, different forms of nominalizations differ in their semantic behaviour. Finally, aspectual restrictions which exist for ingofnominals must be explained.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The solution to be proposed is based on the assumption that non-stative verbs denote changes.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Changes can be conceived of in two different ways, either as objects which bring about a particular result or as relations between states. A dynamic structure of events, intervals and states is defined in which both perspectives can be expressed by means of sorting the universe D. The basic idea is to augment a transition system for Dynamic Logic (DL) by a further domain of events such that programs from DL can be described either as objects or relations between states. The interpretation of verbs is based on the second perspective: they denote (generalized) relations between states.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> The interpretation of nominalized expressions uses the first perspective: they denote changes as objects. Different forms of nominalizations denote different sorts of objects which are systematically related to the denotation of the underlying verb.</Paragraph>
