Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a genetic algorithm based approach to the automatic discovery of finite-state automata (FSAs) from positive data.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> FSAs are commonly used in computational phonology, but - given the limited learnability of FSAs from arbitrary language subsets - are usually constructed manually. The approach presented here offers a practical automatic method that helps reduce the cost of manual FSA construction.</Paragraph>
