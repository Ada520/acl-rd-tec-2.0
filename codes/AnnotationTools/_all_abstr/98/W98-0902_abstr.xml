Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a computational, declarative approach to prosodic morphology that uses inviolable constraints to denote small finite candidate sets which are filtered by a restrictive incremental optimization mechanism. The new approach is illustrated with an implemented fragment of Modern Hebrew verbs couched in MicroCUF, an expressive constraint logic formalism. For generation and parsing of word forms, I propose a novel off-line technique to eliminate run-time optimization. It produces a finite-state oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter's search space. As a byproduct, unknown words can be analyzed without special mechanisms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Unlike pure finite-state transducer approaches, this hybrid setup allows for more expressivity in constraints to specify e.g. token identity for reduplication or arithmetic constraints for phonetics.</Paragraph>
