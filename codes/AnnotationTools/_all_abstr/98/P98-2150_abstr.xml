<Paragraph position="0"> In machine translation and man-machine dialogue, it is important to clarify referents of noun phrases.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present a method for determining the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences by using the referential properties, modifiers, and possessors 1 of noun phrases. Since the Japanese language has no articles, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not. We had previously estimated the referential properties of noun phrases that correspond to articles by using clue words in the sentences (Murata and Nagao 1993). By using these referential properties, our system determined the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Furthermore we used the modifiers and possessors of noun phrases in determining the referents of noun phrases. As a result, on training sentences we obtained a precision rate of 82% and a recall rate of 85% in the determination of the referents of noun phrases that have antecedents. On test sentences, we obtained a precision rate of 79% and a recall rate of 77%.</Paragraph>
