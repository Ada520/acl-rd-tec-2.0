Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Although indexes may overlap, the output of an automatic indexer is generally presented as a fiat and unstructured list of terms. Our purpose is to exploit term overlap and embedding so as to yield a substantial qualitative and quantitative improvement in automatic indexing through concept combination. The increase in the volume of indexing is 10.5% for free indexing and 52.3% for controlled indexing.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The resulting structure of the indexed corpus is a partial conceptual analysis.</Paragraph>
