</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Interactive 3D worlds offer an intriguing testbed for the natural language generation community. To complement interactive 3D worlds' rich visualizations, they ~equire significant linguistic flexibility and communicative * power. We explore the major functionalities and ~rchitectural implications of natural language generation for three key classes of interactive 3D worlds: self. .&amp;quot; explaining 3D environments, habitable 3D learning environments, and interactive 3D narrative worlds. These are illustrated with .empirical investigations underway in our laboratory with severalsuch systems.</Paragraph>
