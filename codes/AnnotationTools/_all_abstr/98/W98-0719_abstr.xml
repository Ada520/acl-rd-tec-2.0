Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The study of lexical semantics has produced a systematic analysis of binary relationships between content words that has greatly benefited lexical search tools and natural language processing algorithms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We first introduce a database system called FreeNet that facilitates the description and exploration of finite binary relations. We then describe the design and implementation of Lexical FreeNet, a semantic network that mixes WordNet-derived semantic relations with data-derived and phonetically-derived relations. We discuss how Lexical FreeNet has aided in lexical discovery, the pursuit of linguistic and factual knowledge by the computer-aided exploration of lexical relations.</Paragraph>
