Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We argue that the current, predominantly task-oriented, approaz~hes to modularizing text * generation, while plausible and useful conceptually, set up spurious conceptual and operational constraints. We propose a data-driven approach to modularization and illustrate how it eliminates * *the previously ubiquitous constraints on combination of evidence across modules and on * control. We also briefly overview the constraint-based control architecture that enables such an approach and facilitates near linear-time processing with realistic texts.</Paragraph>
