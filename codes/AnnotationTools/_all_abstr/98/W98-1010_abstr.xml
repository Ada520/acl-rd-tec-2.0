Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper describes a first attempt to design a morphological analyzer for Akkadian verbal forms. Akkadian is a semitic dead language which was used in the ancient Mesopotamia.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The analyzer described has two levels: the first one is a deterministic and unique paradigm that describes the flexion of Akkadian verbs. The second level is a non deterministic rewriting system which describes possible phonetic transformations of the forms. The results obtained so far are encouraging.</Paragraph>
