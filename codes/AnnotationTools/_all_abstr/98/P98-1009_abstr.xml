Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a trainable and scalable summarization system which utilizes features derived from information retrieval, information extraction, and NLP techniques and on-line resources. The system combines these features using a trainable feature combiner learned from summary examples through a machine learning algorithm. We demonstrate system scalability by reporting results on the best combination of summarization features for different document sources. We also present preliminary results from a task-based evaluation on summarization output usability.</Paragraph>
