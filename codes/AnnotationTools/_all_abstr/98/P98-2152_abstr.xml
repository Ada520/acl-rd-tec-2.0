Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a novel OCR error correction method for languages without word delimiters that have a large character set, such as Japanese and Chinese.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It consists of a statistical OCR model, an approximate word matching method using character shape similarity, and a word segmentation algorithm using a statistical language model. By using a statistical OCR model and character shape similarity, the proposed error corrector outperforms the previously published method. When the baseline character recognition accuracy is 90%, it achieves 97.4% character recognition accuracy.</Paragraph>
