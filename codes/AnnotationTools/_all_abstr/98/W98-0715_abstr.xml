Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a semi-automatic method of inducing underspecified semantic classes from WordNet verbs and nouns. An underspecified semantic class is an abstract semantic class which encodes systematic polysem~f, a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable ways. We show the usefulness of the induced classes in the semantic interpretations and contextual inferences of real-word texts by applying them to the predicate-argument structures in Brown corpus.</Paragraph>
