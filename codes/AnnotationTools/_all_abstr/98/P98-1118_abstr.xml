</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a framework, PRE-SENTOR, for the development and customization of hypertext presentation generators. PRESENTOR offers intuitive and powerful declarative languages specifying the presentation at different levels: macro-planning, micro-planning , realization, and formatting. PRESENTOR is implemented and is portable cross-platform and cross-domain. It has been used with success in several application domains including weather forecasting, object modeling, system description and requirements summarization.</Paragraph>
