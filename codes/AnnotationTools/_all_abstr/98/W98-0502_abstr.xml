Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper investigates the problem of representing coordination constructs in a formal system for the dependency approach to syntax. The distinctive aspect of the formalism is the presence of non-lexical (trace - ~) nodes in the representation. We illustrate the basic mechanisms, and how they can account for syntactic phenomena involving long-distance dependencies. Then, we see how the same mechanism can account for the gaps and ellipses of coordination constructs.</Paragraph>
