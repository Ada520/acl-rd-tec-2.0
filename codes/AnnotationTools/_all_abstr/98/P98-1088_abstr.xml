Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The multiplicative fragment of linear logic has found a number of applications in computational linguistics: in the &amp;quot;glue language&amp;quot; approach to LFG semantics, and in the formulation and parsing of various categorial grammars. These applications call for efficient deduction methods. Although a number of deduction methods for multiplicative linear logic are known, none of them are tabular methods, which bring a substantial efficiency gain by avoiding redundant computation (c.f. chart methods in CFG parsing): this paper presents such a method, and discusses its use in relation to the above applications.</Paragraph>
