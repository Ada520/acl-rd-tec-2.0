Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a media-independent knowledge representation scheme, or content language, for describing the content of communicative goals and actions. The language is used within an intelligent system for automatically generating integrated text and information graphics presentations about complex, quantitative information. The language is designed to satisfy four requirements: to represent information about complex quantitative relations and aggregate properties; compositionality; to represent certain pragmatic distinctions needed for satisfying communicative goals; and to be usable as input by the media-specific generators in our system.</Paragraph>
