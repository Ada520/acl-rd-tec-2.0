Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The view that communication is a form of action serving a variety of specific functions has had a tremendous impact on the philosophy of language and on computational linguistics. Yet, this mode of analysis has been applied to only a narrow range of exchanges (e.g. those whose primary purpose is transferring information or coordinating tasks) while exchanges meant to manage interpersonal relationships, maintain ufacen, or simply to convey thanks, sympathy, and so on have been largely ignored. We present a model of such Usocial perlocutions&amp;quot; that integrates previous work in natural language generation, social psychology, and communication studies. This model has been implemented in a system that generates socially appropriate e-medl in response to user-specified communicative goals.</Paragraph>
