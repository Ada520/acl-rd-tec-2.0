<Paragraph position="0"> Part-of-speech tagging is one of the preliminary steps in many natural language processing systems in which the proper part-of-speech tag of the tokens comprising the sentences are disambiguated using either statistical or symbolic local contextual information. Tagging systems have used either a statistical approach where a large corpora is employed to train a probabilistic model which then is used to tag unseen text, (e.g., Church (1988), Cutting et al. (1992), DeRose (1988)), or a constraint-based approach which employs a large number of hand-crafted linguistic constraints that are used to eliminate impossible sequences or morphological parses for a given word in a given context, recently most prominently exemplified by the Constraint Grammar work (Karlsson et al., 1995; Voutilainen, 1995b; Voutilainen et al., 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993). BriU (1992; 1994; 1995) has presented a transformation-based learning approach.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper extends a novel approach to constraint-based tagging first applied for Turkish (Oflazer and Tiir, 1997), which relieves the rule developer from worrying about conflicting rule ordering requirements and constraints. The approach depends on assigning votes to constraints via statistical and/or manual means, and then letting constraints vote on matching sequences on tokens, as depicted in Figure 1. This approach does not reflect the outcome of matching constraints to the set of morphological parses immediately as usually done in constraint-based systems. Only after all applicable rules are applied to a sentence, tokens are disambiguated in parallel. Thus, the outcome of the rule applications is independent of the order of rule applications.</Paragraph>
