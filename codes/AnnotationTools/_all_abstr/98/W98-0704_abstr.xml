Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> WordNet has been used in information retrieval research by many researchers, but failed to improve the performance of their retrieval system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Thereby in this paper we investigate why the use of WordNet has not been successful. Based on this analysis we propose a method of making WordNet more useful in information retrieval applications. Experiments using several standard information retrieval test collections show that our method results in a significant improvement of information retrieval performance.</Paragraph>
