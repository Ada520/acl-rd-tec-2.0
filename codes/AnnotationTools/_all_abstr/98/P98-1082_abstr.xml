Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports the results of a preliminary experiment on the detection of semantic variants of terms in a French technical document.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The general goal of our work is to help the structuration of terminologies. Two kinds of semantic variants can be found in traditional terminologies : strict synonymy links and fuzzier relations like see-also. We have designed three rules which exploit general dictionary information to infer synonymy relations between complex candidate terms. The results have been examined by a human terminologist. The expert has judged that half of the overall pairs of terms are relevant for the semantic variation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> He validated an important part of the detected links as synonymy. Moreover, it appeared that numerous errors are due to few mis-interpreted links: they could be eliminated by few exception rules.</Paragraph>
