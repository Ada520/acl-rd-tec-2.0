Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Chinese nominals. In particular, we look at lexical rules as a conceptual tool to link forms with the same semantics as is the case between nominalisations and the forms they are derived from. We also address Chinese compounds, illustrating how to recover implicit semantic relations in nominal compounds. Finally, we show how to translate Chinese nontinals within a knowledge-based framework.</Paragraph>
