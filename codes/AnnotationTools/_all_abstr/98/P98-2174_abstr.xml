Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present the design of a practical context-sensitive glosser, incorporating current techniques for lightweight linguistic analysis based on large-scale lexical resources. We outline a general model for ranking the possible translations of the words and expressions that make up a text. This information can be used by a simple resource-bounded algorithm, of complexity O(n log n) in sentence length, that determines a consistent gloss of best translations. We then describe how the results of the general ranking model may be approximated using a simple heuristic prioritisation scheme. Finally we present a preliminary evaluation of the glosser's performance.</Paragraph>
