1 INTRODUCTION
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The primary goal of the Cornell/Sabir TIPSTER Phase III project is to develop techniques to improve the end-user efficiency of information retrieval (IR) systems. We have focused our investigations in four related research areas:  1. High Precision Information Retrieval. The goal of our research in this area is to increase the accuracy of the set of documents given to the user.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> 2. Near-Duplicate Detection. The goal of our work  in near-duplicate detection is to develop methods for delineating or removing from the set of retrieved documents any information that the user has already seen.</Paragraph>
