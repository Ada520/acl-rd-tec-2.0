Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a formal approach and a practical learning method for automatically acquiring phonotactic constraints encoded as finite automata. It is proposed that the use of different classes of syllables with class-specific intra-syl\]abic phonotactics results in a more accurate hypothesis of a language's phonological grammar than the single syllable class traditionally used. Intra-syllabic constraints are encoded as acyclic finite automata with input alphabets of phonemic symbols. These automata in turn form the transitions in cyclic finite automata that encode the inter-syllabic constraints of word-level phonology. A genetic algorithm is used to automatically construct finite automata from training sets of symbol strings.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Results are reported for a set of German syllables and a set of Russian bisyllabic feminine nouns.</Paragraph>
