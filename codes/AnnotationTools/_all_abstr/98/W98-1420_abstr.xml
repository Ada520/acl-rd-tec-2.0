Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Two main problems in natural language generation are lexical selection and syntactic * structure determination. In interlingua approach to machine translation, determining sentence structures becomes more difficult, especially when the interlingua does not contain any syntactic information, in this paper, a knowledge-based computational model which handles these two problems in interlingua approach is presented. The developed system takes interlingua representations of individual sentences, performs lexical selection, and produces frame-based syntactic structures. The system takes all the information about the target language from knowledge resources, in other words its architecture is language-independent. The implemented system is tested with Turkish through small-sized resources such that its output can be fed into a previously developed tactical generator to produce the final realizations of Turkish sentences.</Paragraph>
