Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> After a short recall of our view of dependency grammars, we present two dependency parsers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The first uses dependency relations to have a more concise expression of dependency rules and to get efficiency in parsing. The second uses typed feature structures to add some semantic knowledge on dependency trees and parses in a more robust left to right manner.</Paragraph>
