Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the work achieved in the first half of a 4-year cooperative research project (ARCADE), financed by AUPELF-UREF. The project is devoted to the evaluation of parallel text alignment techniques. In its first period ARCADE ran a competition between six systems on a sentence-to-sentence alignment task which yielded two main types of results. First, a large reference bilingual corpus comprising of texts of different genres was created, each presenting various degrees of difficulty with respect to the alignment task.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Second, significant methodological progress was made both on the evaluation protocols and metrics, and the algoritbm.q used by the different systems. For the second phase, which is now underway, ARCADE has been opened to a larger number of teams who will tackle the problem of word-level alignment.</Paragraph>
