Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a Word Sense Disambiguation method based on the idea of semantic density between words. The disambiguation is done in the context of WordNet. The Internet is used as a raw corpora to provide statistical information for word associations. A metric is introduced and used to measure the semantic density and to rank all possible combinations of the senses of two words. This method provides a precision of 58% in indicating the correct sense for both words at the same time. The precision increases as we consider more choices: 70% for top two ranked and 7'3% for top three ranked.</Paragraph>
