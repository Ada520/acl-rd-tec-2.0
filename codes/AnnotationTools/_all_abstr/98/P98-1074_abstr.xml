Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a new model for word alignments between parallel sentences, which allows one to accurately estimate different parameters, in a computationally efficient way. An application of this model to bilingual terminology extraction, where terms are identified in one language and guessed, through the alignment process, in the other one, is also described. An experiment conducted on a small English-French parallel corpus gave results with high precision, demonstrating the validity of the model.</Paragraph>
