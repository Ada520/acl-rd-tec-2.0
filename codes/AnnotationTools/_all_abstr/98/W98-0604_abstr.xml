Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes how NOMLEX, a dictionary of nominalizations, can be used in Information Extraction (IE). This paper details a procedure which maps syntactic and semantic information designed for writing an IE pattern for an active clause (IBM appointed Alice Smith as vice president) into a set of patterns for nominalizations (e.g., IBM's appointment of Alice Smith as vice president and Alice Smith's appointment as vice president).</Paragraph>
