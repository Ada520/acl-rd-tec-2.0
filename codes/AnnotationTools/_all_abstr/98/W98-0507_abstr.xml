Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we propose to introduce syntactic classes in a lexicalized dependency formalism. Sub-categories of words are organized hierarchically from a general, abstract level (syntactic categories) to a word-specific level (single lexical items). The formalism is parsimonious, and useful for processing. We also sketch a parsing model that uses the hierarchical mixed-grain representation to make predictions on the structure of the input.</Paragraph>
