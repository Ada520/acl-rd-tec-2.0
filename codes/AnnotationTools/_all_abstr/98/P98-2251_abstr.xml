Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper examines the feasibility of using statistical methods to train a part-of-speech predictor for unknown words. By using statistical methods, without incorporating hand-crafted linguistic information, the predictor could be used with any language for which there is a large tagged training corpus. Encouraging results have been obtained by testing the predictor on unknown words from the Brown corpus.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The relative value of information sources such as affixes and context is discussed. This part-of-speech predictor will be used in a part-of-speech tagger to handle out-of-lexicon words.</Paragraph>
