</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes differents methods and tricks in connection with our program which has been entered in the Loebner Prize competition that will happen on Sunday 11 January 1998, at the PowerHouse Museum in Sydney. Of course, this isn't exhaustive, there are other possible techniques but we aim to give the main ideas. We'll speak about the main modules of our program : Spelling correction, Different uses of WordNet, and Generation of comments. Our module used for spelling correction was developed on the basis of works by Brill \[1\], Brill and Marcus \[2\], Golding \[3\], Golding and Schabes \[4\], and Powers \[5\].</Paragraph>
