Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes an Optimality Theory (Prince &amp; Smolensky, 1993) \[OT\]-based generator of the Interlanguage \[IL\] I syllabification of Korean speakers of English. Basically, I accept the ideas of 'cyclic CON-EVAL loop' and 'locally encoded finite candidate set' proposed by Hammond (1995, 1997b).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> However, in order to treat some features of Korean accented English such as vowel epenthesis, segment modification (stop voicing, devoicing, nasalization, etc.), and ambisyllabicity, I suppose that the input string of phonemes be linked to two templates of candidate grid sets; one for syllable position, and the other for (finite) possible output segments for each input segment. I will also use the ALIGN family of constraints to treat the Korean coda neutralization phenomena effectively.</Paragraph>
