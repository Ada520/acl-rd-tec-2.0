</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Applied discourse analysis is a hot topic in Information Retrieval (IR) and the related field of Information Extraction (IE). Although interesting observations about discourse can be made &amp;quot;by hand,&amp;quot; applications require large quantities of data about language -- data which is rather uninteresting.
