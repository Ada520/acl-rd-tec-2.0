Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An analysis that defines predicates for Wordnet verb classes and links them to semantic interpretation is presented. The selectional restrictions for the thematic roles defining the predicates are WordNet ontological categories. Thematic roles are also linked to the syntactic relations that realize them. The paper illustrates the methodology by providing a detailed analysis of some major WordNet verb classes.</Paragraph>
