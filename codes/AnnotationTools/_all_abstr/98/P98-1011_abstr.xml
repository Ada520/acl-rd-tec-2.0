Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach to anaphora resolution based on a focusing algorithm, and implemented within an existing MUC (Message Understanding Conference) Information Extraction system, allowing quantitative evaluation against a substantial corpus of annotated real-world texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Extensions to the basic focusing mechanism can be easily tested, resulting in refinements to the mechanism and resolution rules. Results show that the focusing algorithm is highly sensitive to the quality of syntactic-semantic analyses, when compared to a simpler heuristic-based approach. null</Paragraph>
