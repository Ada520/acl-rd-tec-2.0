Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this document, we outline some elements related to sense variation and to sense delimitation within the perspective of the Generative Lexicon. We then show that, in some cases, the Qualia structure can be combined with or replaced by a small number of rules, which seem to capture more adequately the relationships between the predicator and one of its arguments.</Paragraph>
