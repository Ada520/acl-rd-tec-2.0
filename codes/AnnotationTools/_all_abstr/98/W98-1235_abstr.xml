Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The Loebner Prize is the first, and only regular, competition based on the Turing Test, but in order to stage the competition various modifications to the original test have been made. In particular, the Grand Prize has a controversial and as yet undefined Audio-Visual condition attached to it. This paper discusses the value of the test with and without the A/V condition, and makes a proposal about what the general nature of the A/V test should be.</Paragraph>
