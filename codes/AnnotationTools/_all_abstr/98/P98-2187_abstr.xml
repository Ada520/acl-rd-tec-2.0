Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a semantic interpretation of adjectival modification in terms of the Generative Lexicon. It highlights the elements which can be borrowed from the GL and develops limitations and extensions. We show how elements of the Qualia structure can be incorporated into semantic composition rules to make explicit the semantics of the combination adjective + noun.</Paragraph>
