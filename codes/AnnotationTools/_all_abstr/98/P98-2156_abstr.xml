Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new LR algorithm for tree-adjoining grammars. It is an alternative to an existing algorithm that is shown to be incorrect.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Furthermore, the new algorithm is much simpler, being very close to traditional LR parsing for context-free grammars. The construction of derived trees and the computation of features also become straightforward.</Paragraph>
