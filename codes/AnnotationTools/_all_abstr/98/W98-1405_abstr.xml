Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper Is astudy in the tactics of content selection and realization at the micro-planning level. It presents a .technique for controlling the content and phrasing of complex sentences through* the use of data derived from a parser that has read through a corpus and taken note of which variations do and do not occur in the realization of the concepts in the genre the corpus is taken from. These findings are entered as annotations on a new representational* device, a 'saturation lattice', that provides a systematic way to define partial information and is the jumping off point for the micro-planner. The generator and parser are both based *on a declarative, bi-directional representation of realization relationship between concepts and text.</Paragraph>
