Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we address the problem of choosing the best solution(s) from a set of interpretations of the same object (in our case a segment of text). A notion of preference is stated, based on pairwise comparisons of complete interpretations in order to obtain a partial order among the competing interpretations. An experimental implementation is described, which uses Prolog-like preference statements.</Paragraph>
