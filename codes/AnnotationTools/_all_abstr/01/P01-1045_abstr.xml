Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Chunk parsing has focused on the recognition of partial constituent structures at the level of individual chunks. Little attention has been paid to the question of how such partial analyses can be combined into larger structures for complete utterances. Such larger structures are not only desirable for a deeper syntactic analysis. They also constitute a necessary prerequisite for assigning function-argument structure.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The present paper offers a similarity-based algorithm for assigning functional labels such as subject, object, head, complement, etc. to complete syntactic structures on the basis of pre-chunked input.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The evaluation of the algorithm has concentrated on measuring the quality of functional labels. It was performed on a German and an English treebank using two different annotation schemes at the level of function-argument structure. The results of 89.73 % correct functional labels for German and 90.40 % for English validate the general approach.</Paragraph>
