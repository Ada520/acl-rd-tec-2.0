Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Statistical NLP systems are frequently evaluated and compared on the basis of their performances on a single split of training and test data. Results obtained using a single split are, however, subject to sampling noise. In this paper we argue in favour of reporting a distribution of performance gures, obtained by resampling the training data, rather than a single number. The additional information from distributions can be used to make statistically quanti ed statements about di erences across parameter settings, systems, and corpora. null</Paragraph>
