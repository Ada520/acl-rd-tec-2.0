Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe in this paper the MUMIS Project (Multimedia Indexing and Searching Environment)1, which is concerned with the development and integration of base technologies, demonstrated within a laboratory prototype, to support automated multimedia indexing and to facilitate search and retrieval from multimedia databases. We stress the role linguistically motivated annotations, coupled with domain-specific information, can play within this environment. The project will demonstrate that innovative technology components can operate on multilingual, multisource, and multimedia information and create a meaningful and queryable database.</Paragraph>
