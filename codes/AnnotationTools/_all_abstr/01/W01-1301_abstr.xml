Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a prototype system to visualize and animate 3D scenes from car accident reports, written in French.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The problem of generating such a 3D simulation can be divided into two subtasks: the linguistic analysis and the virtual scene generation. As a means of communication between these two modules, we flrst designed a template formalism to represent a written accident report. The CarSim system flrst processes written reports, gathers relevant information, and converts it into a formal description. Then, it creates the corresponding 3D scene and animates the vehicles.</Paragraph>
