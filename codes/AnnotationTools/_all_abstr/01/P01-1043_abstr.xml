Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a rule-based shallow-parser compiler, which allows to generate a robust shallow-parser for any language, even in the absence of training data, by resorting to a very limited number of rules which aim at identifying constituent boundaries.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We contrast our approach to other approaches used for shallow-parsing (i.e. finite-state and probabilistic methods). We present an evaluation of our tool for English (Penn Treebank) and for French (newspaper corpus &amp;quot;LeMonde&amp;quot;) for several tasks (NP-chunking &amp; &amp;quot;deeper&amp;quot; parsing) .</Paragraph>
