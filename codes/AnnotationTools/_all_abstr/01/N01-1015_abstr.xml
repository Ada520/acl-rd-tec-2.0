Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Using finite-state automata for the text analysis component in a text-to-speech system is problematic in several respects: the rewrite rules from which the automata are compiled are difficult to write and maintain, and the resulting automata can become very large and therefore inefficient. Converting the knowledge represented explicitly in rewrite rules into a more efficient format is difficult. We take an indirect route, learning an efficient decision tree representation from data and tapping information contained in existing rewrite rules, which increases performance compared to learning exclusively from a pronunciation lexicon.</Paragraph>
