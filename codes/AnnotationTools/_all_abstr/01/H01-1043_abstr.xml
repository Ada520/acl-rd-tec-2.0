ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0">  Thispaperdescribesamethodtoconstructacaseframedictionary automatically from a raw corpus. The main problem is how to handle the diversity of verb usages. We collect predicate-argument examples, which are distinguished by the verb and its closest case component in order to deal with verb usages, from parsed results of a corpus. Since these couples multiplyto millionsofcombinations, it isdifficult tomakeawide-coverage case framedictionaryfroma small corpus like an analyzed corpus. We, however, use a rawcorpus,sothatthisproblemcanbeaddressed. Furthermore, we cluster and merge predicate-argument examples whichdoes nothave different usages but belong todifferent case frames because of different closest case components.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We also report on an experimental result of case structure analysis using the constructed case frame dictionary.</Paragraph>
