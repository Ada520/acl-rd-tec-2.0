Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper shows that linguistic techniques along with machine learning can extract high quality noun phrases for the purpose of providing the gist or summary of email messages. We describe a set of comparative experiments using several machine learning algorithms for the task of salient noun phrase extraction. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (i) the modifiers of a noun phrase can be semantically as important as the head, for the task of gisting, (ii) linguistic filtering improves the performance of machine learning algorithms, (iii) a combination of classifiers improves accuracy.</Paragraph>
