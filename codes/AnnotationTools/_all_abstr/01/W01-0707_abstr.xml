Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a general model for PP attachment resolution and NP analysis in French.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We make explicit the different assumptions our model relies on, and show how it generalizes previously proposed models. We then present a series of experiments conducted on a corpus of newspaper articles, and assess the various components of the model, as well as the different information sources used.</Paragraph>
