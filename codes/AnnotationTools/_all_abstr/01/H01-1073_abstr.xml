ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents recent improvements in the development of the University of Colorado &amp;quot;CU Communicator&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;CU-Move&amp;quot; spoken dialog systems. First, we describe the CU Communicator system that integrates speech recognition, synthesis and natural language understanding technologies using the DARPA Hub Architecture. Users are able to converse with an automated travel agent over the phone to retrieve up-to-date travel information such as flight schedules, pricing, along with hotel and rental car availability. The CU Communicator has been under development since April of 1999 and represents our test-bed system for developing robust human-computer interactions where reusability and dialogue system portability serve as two main goals of our work. Next, we describe our more recent work on the CU Move dialog system for in-vehicle route planning and guidance. This work is in joint collaboration with HRL and is sponsored as part of the DARPA Communicator program. Specifically, we will provide an overview of the task, describe the data collection environment for in-vehicle systems development, and describe our initial dialog system constructed for route planning.</Paragraph>
