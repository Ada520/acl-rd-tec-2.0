</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present two language models based upon an &amp;quot;immediate-head&amp;quot; parser -our name for a parser that conditions all events below a constituent c upon the head of c. Whileallofthemost accurate statistical parsers are of the immediate-head variety, no previous grammatical language model uses this technology. The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammar-based language model. For the better of our two models these improvements are 24% and 14% respectively. We also suggest that improvement of the underlying parser should significantly improve the model's perplexity and that even in the near term there is a lot of potential for improvement in immediate-head language models.</Paragraph>
