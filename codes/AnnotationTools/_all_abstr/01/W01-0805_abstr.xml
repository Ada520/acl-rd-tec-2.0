Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a new approach to the generation of referring expressions. We propose to formalize a scene as a labeled directed graph and describe content selection as a subgraph construction problem. Cost functions are used to guide the search process and to give preference to some solutions over others. The resulting graph algorithm can be seen as a meta-algorithm in the sense that defining cost functions in different ways allows us to mimic -and even improve-- a number of well-known algorithms.</Paragraph>
