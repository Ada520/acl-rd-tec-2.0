Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We examine what purpose a dialog metric serves and then propose empirical methods for evaluating systems that meet that purpose. The methods include a protocol for conducting a wizard-of-oz experiment and a basic set of descriptive statistics for substantiating performance claims using the data collected from the experiment as an ideal benchmark or &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; for making comparative judgments. The methods also provide a practical means of optimizing the system through component analysis and cost valuation.</Paragraph>
