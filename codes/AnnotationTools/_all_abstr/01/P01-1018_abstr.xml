Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We consider the question &amp;quot;How much strong generative power can be squeezed out of a formal system without increasing its weak generative power?&amp;quot; and propose some theoretical and practical constraints on this problem. We then introduce a formalism which, under these constraints, maximally squeezes strong generative power out of context-free grammar.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Finally, we generalize this result to formalisms beyond CFG.</Paragraph>
