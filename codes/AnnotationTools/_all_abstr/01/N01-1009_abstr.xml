Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we investigate polysemous adjectives whose meaning varies depending on the nouns they modify (e.g., fast). We acquire the meanings of these adjectives from a large corpus and propose a probabilistic model which provides a ranking on the set of possible interpretations. We identify lexical semantic information automatically by exploiting the consistent correspondences between surface syntactic cues and lexical meaning.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We evaluate our results against paraphrase judgments elicited experimentally from humans and show that the model's ranking of meanings correlates reliably with human intuitions: meanings that are found highly probable by the model are also rated as plausible by the subjects.</Paragraph>
