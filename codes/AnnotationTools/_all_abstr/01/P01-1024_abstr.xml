Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a new framework for dependency grammar, with a modular decomposition of immediate dependency and linear precedence. Our approach distinguishes two orthogonal yet mutually constraining structures: a syntactic dependency tree and a topological dependency tree. The syntax tree is non-projective and even non-ordered, while the topological tree is projective and partially ordered.</Paragraph>
