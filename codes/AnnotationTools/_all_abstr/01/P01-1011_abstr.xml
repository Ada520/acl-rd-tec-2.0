Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> For ambiguous sentences, traditional semantics construction produces large numbers of higher-order formulas, which must then be a0 -reduced individually. Underspecified versions can produce compact descriptions of all readings, but it is not known how to perform a0 -reduction on these descriptions. We show how to do this using a0 -reduction constraints in the constraint language for a1 -structures (CLLS).</Paragraph>
