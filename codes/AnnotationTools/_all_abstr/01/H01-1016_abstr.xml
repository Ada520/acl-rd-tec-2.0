ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we report on our work on a prototype route navigation dialogue system for use in a vehicle. The system delivers spoken turn-by-turn directions, and has been developed to accept naturally phrased navigation queries, as part of our overall effort to create an in-vehicle information system which delivers information as requested while placing minimal cognitive load on the driver.</Paragraph>
