Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Conventional information systems cannot cater for temporal information eectively. For this reason, it is useful to capture and maintain the temporal knowledge (especially the relativeknowledge) associated to each action in an information system. In this paper, weproposea model to mine and organize temporal relations embedded in Chinese sentences.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Three kinds of event expressions are accounted for, i.e. single event, multiple events and declared event(s). Experiments areconducted to evaluatethe mining algorithm using a set of news reports and the results are signicant. Error analysis has also been performed opening up new doors for future research.</Paragraph>
