</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We have developed a discourse level taggingtool forspoken dialoguecorpus using machine learning methods. As discourse level information,we focused on dialogueact, relevance and discourse segment. In dialogue act tagging, we have implemented a transformation-based learning procedure and resulted in 70% accuracy in open test. In relevance and discourse segment tagging, we have implemented a decision-tree based learning procedure and resulted in about 75% and 72% accuracy respectively.</Paragraph>
