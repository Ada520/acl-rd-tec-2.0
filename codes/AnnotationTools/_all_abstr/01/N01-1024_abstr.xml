Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose an algorithm to automatically induce the morphology of inflectional languages using only text corpora and no human input. Our algorithm combines cues from orthography, semantics, and syntactic distributions to induce morphological relationships in German, Dutch, and English. Using CELEX as a gold standard for evaluation, we show our algorithm to be an improvement over any knowledge-free algorithm yet proposed.</Paragraph>
