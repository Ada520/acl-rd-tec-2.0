Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In a headed tree, each terminal word can be uniquely labeled with a governing word and grammatical relation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This labeling is a summary of a syntactic analysis which eliminates detail, reflects aspects of semantics, and for some grammatical relations (such as subject of finite verb) is nearly uncontroversial. We define a notion of expected governor markup, which sums vectors indexed by governors and scaled by probabilistic tree weights.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The quantity is computed in a parse forest representation of the set of tree analyses for a given sentence, using vector sums and scaling by inside probability and flow.</Paragraph>
