Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present two methods for learning the structure of personal names from unlabeled data.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The rst simply uses a few implicit constraints governing this structure to gain a toehold on the problem  |e.g., descriptors come before rst names, which come before middle names, etc.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The second model also uses possible coreference information. We found that coreference constraints on names improve the performance of the model from 92.6% to 97.0%. We are interested in this problem in its own right, but also as a possible way to improve named entity recognition (by recognizing the structure of different kinds of names) and as a way to improve noun-phrase coreference determination.</Paragraph>
