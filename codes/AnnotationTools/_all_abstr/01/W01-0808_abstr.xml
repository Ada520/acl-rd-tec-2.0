Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an overview of a robust, broad-coverage, and application-independent natural language generation system. It demonstrates how the different language generation components function within a multilingual Machine Translation (MT) system, using the languages that we are currently working on (English, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Section 1 provides a system description. Section 2 focuses on the generation components and their core set of rules. Section 3 describes an additional layer of generation rules included to address application-specific issues. Section 4 provides a brief description of the evaluation method and results for the MT system of which our generation components are a part.</Paragraph>
