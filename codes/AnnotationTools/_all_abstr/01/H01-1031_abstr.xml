</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces a set of guidelines for annotating time expressions with a canonicalized representation of the times they refer to. Applications that can benefit from such an annotated corpus include information extraction (e.g., normalizing temporal references for database entry), question answering (answering &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; questions), summarization (temporally ordering information), machine translation (translating and normalizing temporal references), and information visualization (viewing event chronologies).</Paragraph>
