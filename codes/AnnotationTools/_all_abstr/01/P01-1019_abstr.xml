Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We develop a framework for formalizing semantic construction within grammars expressed in typed feature structure logics, including HPSG. The approach provides an alternative to the lambda calculus; it maintains much of the desirable flexibility of unification-based approaches to composition, while constraining the allowable operations in order to capture basic generalizations and improve maintainability.</Paragraph>
