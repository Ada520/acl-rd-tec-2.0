<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces GLARF, a framework for predicate argument structure.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We report on converting the Penn Tree-bank II into GLARF by automatic methods that achieved about 90% precision/recall on test sentences from the Penn Treebank. Plans for a corpus of hand-corrected output, extensions of GLARF to Japanese and applications for MT are also discussed.</Paragraph>
