ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we have been developing a Korean-to-English machine translation system CCLINC (Common Coalition Language System at Lincoln Laboratory). The CCLINC Korean-to-English translation system consists of two core modules, language understanding and generation modules mediated by a language neutral meaning representation called a semantic frame. The key features of the system include: (i) Robust efficient parsing of Korean (a verb final language with overt case markers, relatively free word order, and frequent omissions of arguments). (ii) High quality translation via word sense disambiguation and accurate word order generation of the target language. (iii) Rapid system development and porting to new domains via knowledge-based automated acquisition of grammars. Having been trained on Korean newspaper articles on &amp;quot;missiles&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;chemical biological warfare,&amp;quot; the system produces the translation output sufficient for content understanding of the original document.</Paragraph>
