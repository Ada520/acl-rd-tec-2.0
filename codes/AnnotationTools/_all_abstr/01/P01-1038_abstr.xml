Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present conditions under which verb phrases are elided based on a corpus of positive and negative examples.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Factor that affect verb phrase ellipsis include: the distance between antecedent and ellipsis site, the syntactic relation between antecedent and ellipsis site, and the presence or absence of adjuncts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Building on these results, we examine where in the generation architecture a trainable algorithm for VP ellipsis should be located. We show that the best performance is achieved when the trainable module is located after the realizer and has access to surface-oriented features (error rate of 7.5%).</Paragraph>
