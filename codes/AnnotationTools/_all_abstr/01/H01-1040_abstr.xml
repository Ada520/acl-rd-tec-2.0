ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we show how two standard outputs from information extraction (IE) systems - named entity annotations and scenario templates - can be used to enhance access to text collections via a standard text browser. We describe how this information is used in a prototype system designed to support information workers' access to a pharmaceutical news archive as part of their &amp;quot;industry watch&amp;quot; function. We also report results of a preliminary, qualitative user evaluation of the system, which while broadly positive indicates further work needs to be done on the interface to make users aware of the increased potential of IE-enhanced text browsers.</Paragraph>
