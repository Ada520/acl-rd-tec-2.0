Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Multi-processor systems are becoming more commonplace and a ordable. Based on analyses of actual parsings, we argue that to exploit the capabilities of such machines, uni cation-based grammar parsers should distribute work at the level of individual uni cation operations. We present a generic approach to parallel chart parsing that meets this requirement, and show that an implementation of this technique for LinGO achieves considerable speedups.</Paragraph>
