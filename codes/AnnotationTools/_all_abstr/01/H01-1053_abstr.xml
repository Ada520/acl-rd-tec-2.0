ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a demonstration system built upon Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) technology. The demonstration system monitors a stream of news stories, organizes them into clusters that represent topics, presents the clusters to a user, and visually describes the changes that occur in those clusters over time. A user may also mark certain clusters as interesting, so that they can be &amp;quot;tracked&amp;quot; more easily.</Paragraph>
