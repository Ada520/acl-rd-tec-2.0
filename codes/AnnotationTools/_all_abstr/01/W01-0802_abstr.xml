Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe a two-stage model for content determination in systems that summarise time series data. The first stage involves building a qualitative overview of the data set, and the second involves using this overview, together with the actual data, to produce summaries of the time-series data. This model is based on our observations of how human experts summarise time-series data.</Paragraph>
