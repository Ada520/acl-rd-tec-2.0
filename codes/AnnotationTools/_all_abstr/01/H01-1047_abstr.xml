1. INTRODUCTION
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A recent press release (Murray 2000) indicates that many car manufacturers have announced speech recognition and voiceoperated Command&amp;Control systems for their cars, but so far have not introduced any. They are still struggling with technology, both in reliability and pricing. The article finishes by a quote from an industry person saying: &amp;quot;The reality is that today's systems are still failing in a lot of different modes. [...] But the technology will get better before it reaches the market. Right now, we just don't know when that will be.&amp;quot; In the light of this statement, we consider it appropriate in the context of a scientific conference, to draw the attention of the speech and language community to the fact that in-car speech is on the market, and successfully so, since fall 1996 in Germany and since May 1999 in the USA.</Paragraph>
