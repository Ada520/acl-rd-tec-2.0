Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Though the utility of domain Ontologies is now widely acknowledged in the IT (Information Technology) community, several barriers must be overcome before Ontologies become practical and useful tools. One important achievement would be to reduce the cost of identifying and manually entering several thousand-concept descriptions. This paper describes a text mining technique to aid an Ontology Engineer to identify the important concepts in a Domain Ontology.</Paragraph>
