Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, the issue of document structuring is addressed. To achieve this task, we advocate that Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) is a most expressive discourse framework. Then we sketch a discourse planning mechanism which aims at producing as many paraphrastic document structures as possible from a set of factual data encoded into a logical form.</Paragraph>
