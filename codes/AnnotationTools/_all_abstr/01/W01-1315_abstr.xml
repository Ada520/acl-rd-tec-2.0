Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The aim of this paper is to present a language-neutral, theory-neutral method for annotating sentence-internal temporal relations. The annotation method is simple and can be applied without special training. The annotations are provided with a well-defined model-theoretic interpretation for use in the content-based comparison of annotations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Temporally annotated corpora have a number of applications, in lexicon/induction, translation and linguistic investigation. A searchable multi-language database has already been created.</Paragraph>
