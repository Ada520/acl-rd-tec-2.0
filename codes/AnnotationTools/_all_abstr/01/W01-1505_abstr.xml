Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Recently there has been a growing interest in infrastructures for sharing NLP tools and resources. This paper presents SiSSA, a project that aims at developing an infrastructure for prototyping, editing and validation of NLP application architectures. The system will provide the user with a graphical environment for (1) selecting the NLP activities relevant for the particular NLP task and the associated linguistic processors that execute them; (2) connecting new linguistic processors to SiSSA; (3) checking that the chosen architectural hypothesis corresponds to the functional specifications of the given application.</Paragraph>
