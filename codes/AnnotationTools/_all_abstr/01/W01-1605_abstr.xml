Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe our experience in developing a discourse-annotated corpus for community-wide use.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Working in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory, we were able to create a large annotated resource with very high consistency, using a well-defined methodology and protocol. This resource is made publicly available through the Linguistic Data Consortium to enable researchers to develop empirically grounded, discourse-specific applications.</Paragraph>
