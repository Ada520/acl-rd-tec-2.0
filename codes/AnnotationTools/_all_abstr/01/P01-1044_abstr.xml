Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents empirical studies and closely corresponding theoretical models of the performance of a chart parser exhaustively parsing the Penn Treebank with the Treebank's own CFG grammar. We show howperformanceisdramaticallyaffectedby rule representation and tree transformations, but little by top-down vs. bottom-up strategies. We discuss grammatical saturation, including analysis of the strongly connected components of the phrasal nonterminals in the Treebank, and model how, as sentence length increases, the effective grammar rule size increases as regions of the grammar are unlocked, yielding super-cubic observed time behavior in some configurations.</Paragraph>
