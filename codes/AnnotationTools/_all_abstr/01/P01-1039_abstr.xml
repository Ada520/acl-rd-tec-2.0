Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we address the problem of extracting key pieces of information from voicemail messages, such as the identity and phone number of the caller.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This task differs from the named entity task in that the information we are interested in is a subset of the named entities in the message, and consequently, the need to pick the correct subset makes the problem more difficult. Also, the caller's identity may include information that is not typically associated with a named entity. In this work, we present three information extraction methods, one based on hand-crafted rules, one based on maximum entropy tagging, and one based on probabilistic transducer induction. We evaluate their performance on both manually transcribed messages and on the output of a speech recognition system.</Paragraph>
