ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present the design and development of a Hidden Markov Model for the division of news broadcasts into story segments.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Model topology, and the textual features used, are discussed, together with the non-parametric estimation techniques that were employed for obtaining estimates for both transition and observation probabilities. Visualization methods developed for the analysis of system performance are also presented.</Paragraph>
