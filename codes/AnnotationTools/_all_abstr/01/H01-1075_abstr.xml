<Paragraph position="0"> BravoBrava! is expanding the repertoire of commercial user interfaces by incorporating multimodal techniques combining traditional point and click interfaces with speech recognition, speech synthesis, and gesture recognition. One of these applications is software to help children read. While the child reads aloud, the computer keeps the child on track and offers feedback when the child has difficulty.
