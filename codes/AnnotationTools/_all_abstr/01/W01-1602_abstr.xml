Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe an approach(\variant transduction&amp;quot;) aimed at reducing the eort and skill involved in building spoken language interfaces. Applications are created by specifying a relatively small set of example utterance-action pairs grouped into contexts. No intermediate semantic representations are involved in the specication, and the conrmation requests used in the dialog are constructed automatically. These properties of variant transduction arise from combining techniques for paraphrase generation, classication, and examplematching. We describe howaspoken dialog system is constructed with this approach and also provide some experimental results on varying the number of examples used to build a particular application.</Paragraph>
