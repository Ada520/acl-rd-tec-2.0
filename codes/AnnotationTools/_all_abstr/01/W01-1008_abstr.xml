Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a fully implemented system for fusing related news stories into a single comprehensive description of an event. The basic components and the underlying algorithm are explained. The system uses a computationally feasible and robust notion of entailment for comparing information stemming from different documents.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We discuss the issue of evaluating document fusion and provide some preliminary results.</Paragraph>
