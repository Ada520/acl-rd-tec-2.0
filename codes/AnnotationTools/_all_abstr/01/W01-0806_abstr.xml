Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an algorithm which improves the efficiency of a search for the optimally aggregated paragraph which summarises a flat structured input specification. We model the space of possible paraphrases of possible paragraphs as the space of sequences of compositions of a set of tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) elementary trees. Our algorithm transforms this to a set with equivalent paraphrasing power but better computational properties. Also, it identifies an explicit mapping between input propositions and their possible surface realisations. null</Paragraph>
