Abstract

<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we compare the relative effects of segment order, segmentation and segment contiguity on the retrieval performance of a translation memory system. We take a selection of both bag-of-words and segment order-sensitive string comparison methods, and run each over both characterand word-segmented data, in combination with a rangeof local segment contiguitymodels(intheformofN-grams). null Overtwodistinctdatasets,wefindthat indexing according to simple character bigrams produces a retrieval accuracy superior to any of the tested word Ngrammodels. Further,intheiroptimum configuration,bag-of-wordsmethodsare  showntobeequivalenttosegmentordersensitive methods in terms of retrieval accuracy,butmuchfaster.
