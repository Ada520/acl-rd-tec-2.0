1. Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an algorithm for identifying noun phrase antecedents of personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, reflexive pronouns, and omitted pronouns (zero pronouns) in Spanish. The algorithm identifies both intrasentential and intersentential antecedents and is applied to the syntactic analysis generated by the slot unification parser (SUP) (Ferr~ndez, Palomar, and Moreno 1998b). It also combines different forms of knowledge by distinguishing between constraints and preferences. Whereas constraints are used as combinations of several kinds of knowledge (lexical, morphological, and syntactic), preferences are defined as a combination of heuristic rules extracted from a study of different corpora.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present the following main contributions in this paper:  applied to Spanish texts using the same blind test In Section 2, we show the classification scheme we used to identify the different types of anaphora that we would be resolving. In Section 3, we present the algorithm and discuss its main properties. In Section 4, we evaluate the algorithm. In Section 5, we compare our algorithm with several other approaches to anaphora resolution. Finally, we present our conclusions.</Paragraph>
