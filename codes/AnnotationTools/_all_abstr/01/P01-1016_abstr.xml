Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper addresses the issue of designing embodied conversational agents that exhibit appropriate posture shifts during dialogues with human users. Previous research has noted the importance of hand gestures, eye gaze and head nods in conversations between embodied agents and humans.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present an analysis of human monologues and dialogues that suggests that postural shifts can be predicted as a function of discourse state in monologues, and discourse and conversation state in dialogues. On the basis of these findings, we have implemented an embodied conversational agent that uses Collagen in such a way as to generate postural shifts.</Paragraph>
