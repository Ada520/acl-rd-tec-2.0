</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an open-domain textual Question-Answering system that uses several feedback loops to enhance its performance. These feedback loops combine in a new way statistical results with syntactic, semantic or pragmatic information derived from texts and lexical databases. The paper presents the contribution of each feed-back loop to the overall performance of 76% human-assessed precise answers.</Paragraph>
