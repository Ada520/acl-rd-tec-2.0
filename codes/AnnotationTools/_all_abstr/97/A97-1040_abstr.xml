Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A multilingual Internet-based employment advertisement system is described. Job ads are submitted as e-mail texts, analysed by an example-based pattern matcher and stored in language-independent schemas in an object-oriented database. Users can search the database in their own language and get customized summaries of the job ads. The query engine uses symbolic case-based reasoning techniques, while the generation module integrates canned text, templates, and grammar rules to produce texts and hypertexts in a simple way.</Paragraph>
