ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a novel multimodal system applied to the setup and control of distributed interactive simulations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We have developed the QuickSet prototype, a pen/voice system running on a hand-held PC, communicating through a distributed agent architecture to NRaD's ~ LeatherNet system, a distributed interactive training simulator built for the US Marine Corps (USMC). The paper briefly describes the system and illustrates its use in multimodal simulation setup.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> KEYWORDS: multimodal interfaces, agent architecture, gesture recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, distributed interactive simulation.</Paragraph>
