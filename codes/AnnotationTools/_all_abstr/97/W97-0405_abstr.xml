Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Since spoken language is characterized by a number of properties that defy interpretation and translation by purely grammar-based techniques, recent interest has turned to analogical (also known as case-based or example-based) approaches. In this framework, the most important step consists of robustly matching the recognized input expression with the stored examples. This paper presents a probabilistic formalization of analogical matching, and describes how this model is applied to speech translation in the framework of translation by analogy.</Paragraph>
