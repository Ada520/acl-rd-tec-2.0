Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a method for compiling grammars into efficient code for head-driven generation in ALE. Like other compilation techniques already used in ALE, this method integrates ALE's compiled code for logical operations with control-specific information from (SNMP90)'s algorithm along with user-defined directives to identify semantics-related substructures. This combination provides far better performance than typical bi-directional feature-based parser/generators, while requiring a minimum of adjustment to the grammar signature itself, and a minimum of extra compilation.</Paragraph>
