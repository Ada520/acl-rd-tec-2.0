Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the LT NSL system (McKelvie et al, 1996), an architecture for writing corpus processing tools. This system is then compared with two other systems which address similar issues, the GATE system (Cunningham et al, 1995) and the IMS Corpus Workbench (Christ, 1994). In particular we address the advantages and disadvantages of an SGML approach compared with a non-SGML database approach.</Paragraph>
