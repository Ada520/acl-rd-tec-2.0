Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> GLOSSER is designed to support reading and learning to read in a foreign language. There are four language pairs currently supported by GLOSSER: English-Bulgarian, English-Estonian, English-Hungarian and French-Dutch. The program is operational on UNIX and Windows '95 platforms, and has undergone a pilot user-study. A demonstration (in UNIX) for Applied Natural Language Processing emphasizes components put to novel technical uses in intelligent computer-assisted morphological analysis (ICALL), including disambiguated morphological analysis and lemmatized indexing for an aligned bilingual corpus of word examples.</Paragraph>
