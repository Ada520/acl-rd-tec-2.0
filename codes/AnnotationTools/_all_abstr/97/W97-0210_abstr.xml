Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach for tagging verb sense that combines a domain-independent method based on subcategorization and alternations with a domain-dependent method utilizing statistically extracted verb clusters. Initial results indicate that verb senses can be pruned for highly polysemous verbs by up to 74% by the first method and by up to 85% by the second method.</Paragraph>
