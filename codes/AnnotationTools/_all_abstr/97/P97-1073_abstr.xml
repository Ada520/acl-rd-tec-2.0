Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A compositional account of the semantics of German prefix verbs in HPSG is outlined. We consider only those verbs that are formed by productive synchronic rules.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Rules are fully productive if they apply to all base verbs which satisfy a common description. Prefixes can be polysemous and have separate, highly underspecified lexical entries. Adequate bases are determined via selection restrictions.</Paragraph>
