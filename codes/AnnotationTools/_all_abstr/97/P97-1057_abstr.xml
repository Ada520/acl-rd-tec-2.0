Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> String transformation systems have been introduced in (Brill, 1995) and have several applications in natural language processing. In this work we consider the computational problem of automatically learning from a given corpus the set of transformations presenting the best evidence. We introduce an original data structure and efficient algorithms that learn some families of transformations that are relevant for part-of-speech tagging and phonological rule systems. We also show that the same learning problem becomes NP-hard in cases of an unbounded use of don't care symbols in a transformation.</Paragraph>
