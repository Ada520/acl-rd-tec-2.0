Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Syntactic coindexing restrictions are by now known to be of central importance to practical anaphor resolution approaches.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Since, in particular due to structural ambiguity, the assumption of the availability of a unique syntactic reading proves to be unrealistic, robust anaphor resolution relies on techniques to overcome this deficiency.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> In this paper, two approaches are presented which generalize the verification of coindexing constraints to deficient descriptions. At first, a partly heuristic method is described, which has been implemented. Secondly, a provable complete method is specified. It provides the means to exploit the results of anaphor resolution for a further structural disambiguation. By rendering possible a parallel processing model, this method exhibits, in a general sense, a higher degree of robustness. As a practically optimal solution, a combination of the two approaches is suggested.</Paragraph>
