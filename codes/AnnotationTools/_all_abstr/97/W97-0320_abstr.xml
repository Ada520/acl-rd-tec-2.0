Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation of temporal reference resolution in scheduling dialogs. The algorithm adopted is primarily a linear-recency based approach that does not include a model of global focus. A fully automatic system has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data with good results. This paper presents the results of an intercoder reliability study, a model of temporal reference resolution that supports linear recency and has very good coverage, the results of the system evaluated on unseen test data, and a detailed analysis of the dialogs assessing the viability of the approach.</Paragraph>
