Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Telegraphic messages with numerous instances of omission pose a new challenge to parsing in that a sentence with omission causes a higher degree of ambi6uity than a sentence without omission. Misparsing reduced by omissions has a far-reaching consequence in machine translation. Namely, a misparse of the input often leads to a translation into the target language which has incoherent meaning in the given context.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This is more frequently the case if the structures of the source and target languages are quite different, as in English and Korean. Thus, the question of how we parse telegraphic messages accurately and efficiently becomes a critical issue in machine translation. In this paper we describe a technical solution for the issue, and reSent the performance evaluation of a machine transtion system on telegraphic messages before and after adopting the proposed solution. The solution lies in a grammar design in which lexicalized grammar rules defined in terms of semantic categories and syntactic rules defined in terms of part-of-speech are utilized toether. The proposed grammar achieves a higher parsg coverage without increasing the amount of ambiguity/misparsing when compared with a purely lexicalized semantic grammar, and achieves a lower degree of. ambiguity/misparses without, decreasing the parsmg coverage when compared with a purely syntactic grammar.</Paragraph>
