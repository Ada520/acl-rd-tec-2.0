Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Sense tagging, the automatic assignment of the appropriate sense from some lexicon to each of the words in a text, is a specialised instance of the general problem of semantic tagging by category or type. We discuss which recent word sense disambignation algorithms are appropriate for sense tagging.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It is our belief that sense tagging can be carried out effectively by combining several simple, independent, methods and we include the design of such a tagger. A prototype of this system has been implemented, correctly tagging 86% of polysemous word tokens in a small test set, providing evidence that our hypothesis is correct.</Paragraph>
