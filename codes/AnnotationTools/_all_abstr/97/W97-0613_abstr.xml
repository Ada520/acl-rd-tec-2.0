</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a new technology for using small collections of example sentences to automatically restrict a speech recognition grammar to allow only the more plausible subset of the sentences it would otherwise admit. This technology is unusual because it bridges the gap between hand-built grammars (used with no training data) and statistical approaches (which require significant data).</Paragraph>
