Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a unified framework in which to treat semantic underspecification and parallelism phenomena in discourse. The framework employs a constraint language that can express equality and subtree relations between finite trees. In addition, our constraint language can express the equality up-to relation over trees which captures parallelism between them. The constraints are solved by context unification.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We demonstrate the use of our framework at the examples of quantifier scope, ellipsis, and their interaction. 1</Paragraph>
