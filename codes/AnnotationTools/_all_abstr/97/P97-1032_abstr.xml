Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Concerning different approaches to automatic PoS tagging: EngCG-2, a constraint-based morphological tagger, is compared in a double-blind test with a state-of-the-art statistical tagger on a common disambiguation task using a common tag set. The experiments show that for the same amount of remaining ambiguity, the error rate of the statistical tagger is one order of magnitude greater than that of the rule-based one. The two related issues of priming effects compromising the results and disagreement between human annotators are also addressed.</Paragraph>
