Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a variation on classic beam thresholding techniques that is up to an order of magnitude faster than the traditional method, at the same performance level. We also present a new thresholding technique, global thresholding, which, combined with the new beam thresholding, gives an additional factor of two improvement, and a novel technique, multiple pass parsing, that can be combined with the others to yield yet another 50% improvement. We use a new search algorithm to simultaneously optimize the thresholding parameters of the various algorithms.</Paragraph>
