Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a prototype system for key term manipulation and visualization in a real-world commercial environment. The system consists of two components. A preprocessor generates a set of key terms from a text dataset which represents a specific topic. The generated key terms are organized in a hierarchical structure and fed into a graphic user interface (GUI). The friendly and interactive GUI toolkit allows the user to visualize the key terms in context and explore the content of the original dataset.</Paragraph>
