Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe EFLUF - an implementation of FLUF. The idea with this environment is to achieve a base for experimenting with unification grammars. In this environment we want to allow the user to affect as many features as possible of the formalism, thus being able to test and compare various constructions proposed for unification-based formalisms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The paper exemplifies the main features of EFLUF and shows how these can be used for defining a grammar. The most interesting features of EFLUF are the various possibilities to affect the behavior of the system. The user can define new constructions and how they unify, define new syntax for his constructions and use external unification modules.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The paper also gives a discussion on how a system like EFLUF would work for a larger application and suggests some additional features and restrictions that would be needed for this.</Paragraph>
