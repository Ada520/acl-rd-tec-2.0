Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We compare four similarity-based estimation methods against back-off and maximum-likelihood estimation methods on a pseudo-word sense disambiguation task in which we controlled for both unigram and bigram frequency. The similarity-based methods perform up to 40% better on this particular task. We also conclude that events that occur only once in the training set have major impact on similarity-based estimates.</Paragraph>
