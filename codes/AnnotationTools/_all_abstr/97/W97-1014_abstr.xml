</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we study the use of so-called word trigger pairs to improve an existing language model, which is typically a tri-gram model in combination with a cache component. A word trigger pair is defined as a long-distance word pair. We present two methods to select the most significant single word trigger pairs. The selected trigger pairs are used in a combined model where the interpolation parameters and trigger interaction parameters are trained by the EM algorithm.</Paragraph>
