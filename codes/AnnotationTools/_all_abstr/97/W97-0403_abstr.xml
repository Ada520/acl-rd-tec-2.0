Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper argues that stylistically and pragmatically high-quality spoken language translation requires the transfer of pragmatic information at an abstract level of &amp;quot;utterance strategies&amp;quot;. A new categorization of spoken language phenomena into essentially non-meaningful &amp;quot;speech errors&amp;quot;, and purposeful &amp;quot;natural speech properties&amp;quot; is introduced, and the manner in which natural speech properties convey pragmatic information is described. Finally, an extension of the analogical speech translation approach is proposed that accounts for such higher-level pragmatic information. null</Paragraph>
