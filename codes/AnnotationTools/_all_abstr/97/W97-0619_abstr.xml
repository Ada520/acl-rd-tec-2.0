</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The Alparon project aims to improve Vxos, Openbaar Vervoer Reisinformatie's (OVa) automated speech processing system for public transport information, by using a corpus-based approach. The shortcomings of the current system have been investigated, and a study is made of how dialogues in the OVR domain usually occur between a human operator and a client. While centering our attention on the presentation of information by the Automated Speech Processing (ASP) system, we describe the implications of this corpus-based approach on the implementation of our prototype.</Paragraph>
