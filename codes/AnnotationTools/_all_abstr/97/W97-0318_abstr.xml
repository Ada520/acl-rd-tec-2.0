Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Fourteen linguistically-motivated numerical indicators are evaluated for their ability to categorize verbs as either states or events. The values for each indicator are computed automatically across a corpus of text. To improve classification performance, machine learning techniques are employed to combine multiple indicators.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Three machine learning methods are compared for this task: decision tree induction, a genetic algorithm, and log-linear regression. null</Paragraph>
