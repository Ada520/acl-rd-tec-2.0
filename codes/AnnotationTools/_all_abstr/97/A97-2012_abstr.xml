1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Eucalyptus and InterLACE are two projects integrating spoken natural language interaction with the already-developed graphical user interfaces of currently existing military simulation systems. We take this approach (rather than developing new, fully integrated systems from scratch) to facilitate the development of Navy demonstrations of NL technology applied to their own tools, as well as to explore the relative strengths and weaknesses of graphical vs. NL interfaces and how the two can be used in combination to yield more powerful interaction techniques. The natural language processing capability of the two systems is described in an accompanying Proceedings technical note (Wauchope et al. 1997); here we go into a bit more detail on the issues of multimodal integration with graphical interfaces.</Paragraph>
