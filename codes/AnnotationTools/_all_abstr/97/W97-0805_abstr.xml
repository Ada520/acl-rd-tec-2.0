</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a prototype of the Italian version of WORDNET, a general computational lexical resource. Some relevant extensions are discussed to make it usable for parsing: in particular we add verbal selectional restrictions to make lexical discrimination effective. Italian WORDNET has been coupled with a parser and a number of experiments have been performed to individuate the methodology with the best trade-off between disambiguation rate and precision. Results confirm intuitive hypothesis on the role of selectional restrictions and show evidences for a WORDNET-Iike organization of lexical senses.</Paragraph>
