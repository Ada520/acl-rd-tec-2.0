Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A major concern in corpus based approaches is that the applicability of the acquired knowledge may be limited by some feature of the corpus, in particular, the notion of text 'domain'. In order to examine the domain dependence of parsing, in this paper, we report 1) Comparison of structure distributions across domains; 2) Examples of domain specific structures; and 3) Parsing experiment using some domain dependent grammars. The observations using the Brown corpus demonstrate domain dependence and idiosyncrasy of syntactic structure. The parsing results show that the best accuracy is obtained using the grammar acquired from the same domain or the same class (fiction or nonfiction). We will also discuss the relationship between parsing accuracy and the size of training corpus.</Paragraph>
