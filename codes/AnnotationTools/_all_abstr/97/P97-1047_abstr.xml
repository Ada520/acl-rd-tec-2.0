Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Decoding algorithm is a crucial part in statistical machine translation. We describe a stack decoding algorithm in this paper.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present the hypothesis scoring method and the heuristics used in our algorithm.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We report several techniques deployed to improve the performance of the decoder.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> We also introduce a simplified model to moderate the sparse data problem and to speed up the decoding process. We evaluate and compare these techniques/models in our statistical machine translation system. null</Paragraph>
