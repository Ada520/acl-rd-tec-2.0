Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a self-organized method to build a stochastic Japanese word segmenter from a small number of basic words and a large amount of unsegmented training text. It consists of a word-based statistical language model, an initial estimation procedure, and a re-estimation procedure. Initial word frequencies are estimated by counting all possible longest match strings between the training text and the word list. The initial word list is au~nented by identifying words in the training text using a heuristic rule based on character type. The word-based language model is then re-estimated to filter out inappropriate word hypotheses generated by the initial word identification. When the word segmeuter is trained on 3.9M character texts and 1719 initial words, its word segmentation accuracy is 86.3% recall and 82.5% precision. We find that the combination of heuristic word identi~cation and re-estimation is so effective that the initial word list need not be large.</Paragraph>
