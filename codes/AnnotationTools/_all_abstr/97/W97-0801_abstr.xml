Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses the design of the EuroWordNet database, in which semantic data-bases like WordNetl.5 for several languages are combined via a so-called inter-lingual-index. In this database, language-independent data is shared and language-specific properties are maintained as well. A special interface has been developed to compare the semantic configurations across languages and to track down differences. The pragmatic design of the database makes it possible to gather empirical evidence for a common cross-linguistic ontology.</Paragraph>
