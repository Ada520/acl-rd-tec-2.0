Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The shift from Computational Linguistics to Language Engineering is indicative of new trends in NLP. This paper reviews two NLP engineering problems: reuse and integration, while relating these concerns to the larger context of applied NLP. It presents a software architecture which is geared to support the development of a variety of large-scale NLP applications: Information Retrieval, Corpus Processing, Multilingual MT, and integration of Speech Components.</Paragraph>
