Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We compare the effectiveness of two related * machine translation models applied to the same limited-domain task. One is a transfer model with monolingual head automata for analysis and generation; the other is a direct transduction model based on bilingual head transducers. We conclude that the head transducer model is more effective according to measures of accuracy, computational requirements, model size, and development effort.</Paragraph>
