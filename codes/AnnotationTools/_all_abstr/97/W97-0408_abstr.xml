Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe the head transducer model used in an experimental English-to-Mandarin speech translation system. Head transduction is a translation method in which weighted finite state transducers are associated with source-target word pairs. The method is suitable for speech translation because it allows efficient bottom up processing.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The head transducers in the experimental system have a wider range of output positions than input positions. This asymmetry is motivated by a tradeoff between model complexity and search efficiency. null</Paragraph>
