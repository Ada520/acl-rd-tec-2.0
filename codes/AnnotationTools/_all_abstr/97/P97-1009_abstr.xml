Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Most previous corpus-based algorithms disambiguate a word with a classifier trained from previous usages of the same word.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Separate classifiers have to be trained for different words. We present an algorithm that uses the same knowledge sources to disambiguate different words. The algorithm does not require a sense-tagged corpus and exploits the fact that two different words are likely to have similar meanings if they occur in identical local contexts.</Paragraph>
