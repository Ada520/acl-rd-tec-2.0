Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an algorithm for the compilation of regular formalisms with rule features into finite-state automata. Rule features are incorporated into the right context of rules. This general notion can also be applied to other algorithms which compile regular rewrite rules into automata. null</Paragraph>
