<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approachto text summanzatlon that m entirely rooted m the formal descnptlon of a classtficatmn-based model of termmologlcal knowledge representahon and reasoning Text summarization m conmdered an operator-based transformation process by which knowledge representation structures, as generated by the text understander, are mapped to conceptually condensed representahon structures forming a text summary at the representation level . The framework we propose offers a variety of subtle parameters on which scalable text summarlzahon can be based</Paragraph>
