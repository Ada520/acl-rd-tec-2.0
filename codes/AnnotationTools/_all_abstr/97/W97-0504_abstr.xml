Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Profet, a word prediction program, has been in use for the last ten years as a writing aid, and was designed to accelerate the writing process and minimize the writing effort for persons with motor dysfunction. It has also proved to be beneficial in spelling and text construction for persons with reading and writing difficulties due to linguistic impairments. With higher linguistic demands on support for individuals with severe reading and writing difficulties, including dyslexia, the need for an improved version of Profet has arisen.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, the new functionality will be presented, and the possible implications for support at different linguistic levels will be discussed. Results from an evaluation study with individuals with motoric dysfunction and/or dyslexia will be presented at the workshop in Madrid.</Paragraph>
