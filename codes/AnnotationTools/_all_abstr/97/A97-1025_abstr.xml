Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Contextual spelling errors are defined as the use of an incorrect, though valid, word in a particular sentence or context. Traditional spelling checkers flag misspelled words, but they do not typically attempt to identify words that are used incorrectly in a sentence. We explore the use of Latent Semantic Analysis for correcting these incorrectly used words and the results are compared to earlier work based on a Bayesian classifier.</Paragraph>
