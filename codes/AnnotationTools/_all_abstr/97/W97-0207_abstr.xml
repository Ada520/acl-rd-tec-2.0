Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Semantic entropy is a measure of semantic -mbiguity and uninformativehess. It is a graded lexical feature which may play a role anywhere lexical semantics plays a role. This paper presents a method for measuring semantic entropy using translational distributions of words in parallel text corpora. The measurement method is well-defined for all words, including function words, and even for punctuation. null</Paragraph>
