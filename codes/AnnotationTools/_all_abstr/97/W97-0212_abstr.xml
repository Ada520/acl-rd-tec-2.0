Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a working sense tagger, which attempts to automatically link each word in a text corpus to its corresponding sense in a machine-readable dictionary. It uses information automatically extracted from the MRD to find matches between the dictionary and the Corpus sentences, and combines different types of information by simple additive scores with manually set weightings.</Paragraph>
