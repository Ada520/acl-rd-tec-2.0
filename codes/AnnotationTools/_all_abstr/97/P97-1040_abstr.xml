Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces primitive Optimality Theory (OTP), a linguistically motivated formalization of OT. OTP specifies the class of autosegmental representations, the universal generator Gen, and the two simple families of permissible constraints.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In contrast to less restricted theories using Generalized Alignment, OTP's optimal surface forms can be generated with finite-state methods adapted from (Ellison, 1994). Unfortunately these methods take time exponential on the size of the grammar. Indeed the generation problem is shown NP-complete in this sense. However, techniques are discussed for making Ellison's approach fast in the typical case, including a simple trick that alone provides a 100-fold speedup on a grammar fragment of moderate size. One avenue for future improvements is a new finite-state notion, &amp;quot;factored automata,&amp;quot; where regular languages are represented compactly via formal intersections N~=IAi of FSAs.</Paragraph>
