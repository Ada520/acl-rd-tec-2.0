</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a method for extending an existing thesaurus through classification of new words in terms of that thesaurus. New words are classified on the basis of relative probabilities of.a word belonging to a given word class, with the probabilities calculated using noun-verb co-occurrence pairs. Experiments using the Japanese Bunruigoihy5 thesaurus on about 420,000 co-occurrences showed that new words can be classified correctly with a maximum accuracy of more than 80%.</Paragraph>
