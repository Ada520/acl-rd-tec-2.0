</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Repair processing plays an important role in spoken language processing systems. This paper proposes a method for correcting Chinese repetition repairs and demonstrates the effects of repair processing in Chinese homophone disambiguation. The experimental results show that the precision rate of 93.87% and the recall rate of 90*65% can be achieved for the repair processing.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> At the same time, 50% of errors in the repairing segments can be reduced for Chinese homophone disambiguation.</Paragraph>
