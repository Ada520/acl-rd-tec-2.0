Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a scalable summarization system which takes advantage of robust NLP technology such as corpus-based statlshcal NLP techmques, information extractmn and readily available on-hne resources The system attempts to compensate for the bottlenecks of traditional frequency-based, knowledge-based or discourse-based summanzatlon approaches by uhhzlng features derived by these robust techniques Prehrmnary evaluation results are reported, and the multi-dimensional summary viewer is described</Paragraph>
