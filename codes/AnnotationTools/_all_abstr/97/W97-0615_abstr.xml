Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Our work addresses the integration of speech recognition and language processing for whole spoken dialogue systems.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> To filter ill-recognized words, we design an on-line computing of word confidence scores based on the recognizer output hypothesis. To infer as much information as possible from the retained sequence of words, we propose a bottom-up syntactico-semantic robust parsing relying on a lexicalized tree grammar and on integrated repairing strategies.</Paragraph>
