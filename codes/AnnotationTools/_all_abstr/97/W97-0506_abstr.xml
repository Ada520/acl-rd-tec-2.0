Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Current communication devices designed for non-speaking users are inadequate to support conversation because the speed with which a user can input information is typically very limited. We describe some practical work on word prediction, and discuss its limitations as a technique for speeding up free text entry. We then outline an alternative approach, currently under development, which combines prediction with a constrained technique for natural language generation.</Paragraph>
