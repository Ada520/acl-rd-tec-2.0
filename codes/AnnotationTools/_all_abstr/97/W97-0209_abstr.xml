Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The absence of training data is a real problem for corpus-based approaches to sense disambiguation, one that is unlikely to be solved soon. Selectional preference is traditionally connected with sense ambiguity; this paper explores how a statistical model of selectional preference, requiring neither manual annotation of selection restrictions nor supervised training, can be used in sense disambiguation.</Paragraph>
