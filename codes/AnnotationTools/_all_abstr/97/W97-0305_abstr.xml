Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe here an algorithm for detecting subject boundaries within text based on a statistical lexical similarity measure.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Hearst has already tackled this problem with good results (Hearst, 1994). One of her main assumptions is that a change in subject is accompanied by a change in vocabulary. Using this assumption, but by introducing a new measure of word significance, we have been able to build a robust and reliable algorithm which exhibits improved accuracy without sacrificing language independency.</Paragraph>
