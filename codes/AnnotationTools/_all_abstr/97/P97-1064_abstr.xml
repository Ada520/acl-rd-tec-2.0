Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper presents a language model that develops syntactic structure and uses it to extract meaningful information from the word history, thus enabling the use of long distance dependencies. The model assigns probability to every joint sequence of words-binary-parse-structure with head-word annotation. The model, its probabilistic parametrization, and a set of experiments meant to evaluate its predictive power are presented.</Paragraph>
