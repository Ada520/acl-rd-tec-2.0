Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present the lexical-semantic net for German &amp;quot;GermaNet&amp;quot; which integrates conceptual ontological information with lexical semantics, within and across word classes. It is compatible with the Princeton WordNet but integrates principle-based modifications on the constructional and organizational level as well as on the level of lexical and conceptual relations. GermaNet includes a new treatment of regular polysemy, artificial concepts and of particle verbs. It furthermore encodes cross-classification and basic syntactic information, constituting an interesting tool in exploring the interaction of syntax and semantics. The development of such a large scale resource is particularly important as German up to now lacks basic online tools for the semantic exploration of very large corpora.</Paragraph>
