Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a new approach to bitext correspondence problem (BCP) of noisy bilingual corpora based on image processing (IP) techniques.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> By using one of several ways of estimating the lexical translation probability (LTP) between pairs of source and target words, we can turn a bitext into a discrete gray-level image. We contend that the BCP, when seen in this light, bears a striking resemblance to the line detection problem in IP.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Therefore, BCPs, including sentence and word alignment, can benefit from a wealth of effective, well established IP techniques, including convolution-based filters, texture analysis and Hough transform. This paper describes a new program, PlotAlign that produces a word-level bitext map for noisy or non-literal bitext, based on these techniques.</Paragraph>
