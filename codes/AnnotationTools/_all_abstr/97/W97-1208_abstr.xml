Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes an experimental method for detecting prosodic functions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We assume that the first step towards content driven synthetic prosody generation (Concept-to-speech) is invariably to determine the perceptually relevant prosodic features. The proposed method has been applied to the detection of syntactic structure: dialogue acts and given/new distinction. First results are being discussed.</Paragraph>
