ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper investigates the use of sentential pronouns in English and Norwegian. We argue that resolution of sentential pronouns is sensitive to the distinction between forms whose referents must be in focus and forms whose referents must only be activated, but not necessarily in focus. An investigation of the distribution and interpretation of sentential pronouns also reveals that the relative salience of a higher order discourse endty is influenced by syntactic structure as well as extralinguistic factors.</Paragraph>
