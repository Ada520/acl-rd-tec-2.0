Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the conversion of a Hidden Markov Model into a sequential transducer that closely approximates the behavior of the stochastic model. This transformation is especially advantageous for part-of-speech tagging because the resulting transducer can be composed with other transducers that encode correction rules for the most frequent tagging errors.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The speed of tagging is also improved. The described methods have been implemented and successfully tested on six languages.</Paragraph>
