Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a logic-based computational model for movement theory in Government and Binding Theory. For that purpose, we have designed a language called DISLOG.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> DISLOG stands for programming in logic with discontinuities and permits to express in a simple, concise and declarative way relations or constraints between non-contiguous elements in a structure.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> DISLOG is also weel adapted to model other types of linguistic phenomena like Quantifier Raising involving long-distance relations or constraints.</Paragraph>
