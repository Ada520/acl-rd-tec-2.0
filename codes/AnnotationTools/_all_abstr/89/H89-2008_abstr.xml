ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> As part of the DARPA Spoken Language System program, we recently initiated an effort in spoken language understanding. A spoken language system addresses applications in which speech is used for interactive problem solving between a person and a computer. In these applications, not only must the system convert the speech signal into text, it must also understand the linguistic structure of a sentence in order to generate the correct response. This paper describes our early experience with the development of the MIT VOYAGER spoken language system.</Paragraph>
