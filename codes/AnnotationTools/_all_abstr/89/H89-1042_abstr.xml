<Paragraph position="0"> SRI has developed a speaker-independent continuous speech, large vocabulary speech recognition system, DECIPHER, that provides state-of-the-art performance on the DARPA standard speaker-independent resource management training and testing materials. SRI's approach is to integrate speech and linguistic knowledge into the HMM framework.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper describes performance improvements arising from detailed phonological modeling and from the incorporation of cross-word coarticulatory constraints.</Paragraph>
