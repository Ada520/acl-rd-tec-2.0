PRACTICAL PARSING OF GENERALIZED PHRASE STRUCTURE GRAMMARS
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An efficient algorithm is described for parsing a dialect of generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG). A practical parsing system, based on the algorithm, is presented. The dialect of GPSG which the parsing system accepts is smaller, but considerably &amp;quot;purer&amp;quot; (closer to the original definition of GPSG) and mathematically &amp;quot;cleaner&amp;quot; than that which is accepted by other practical parsing systems.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In particular, the parsing system correctly implements feature co-occurrence restrictions, subject only to the restriction that the FCR set can be expressed in clausal form as a set of Horn clauses.</Paragraph>
