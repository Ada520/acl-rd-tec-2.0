ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we will discuss our development of a new grammar that is to be used for evaluation of speech recognition systems. The grammar is a statistical first-order class grammar and has been developed for for two different task domains (the DARPA 1000-word Resource Management domain and a 2000-word personnel database domain). We will first motivate the development of this grammar, next describe the grammar and its development, and finally present results and conclusions. null</Paragraph>
