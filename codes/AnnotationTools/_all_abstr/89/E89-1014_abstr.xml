</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a logical treatment of semi-free word order and bounded discontinuous constituency. We extend standard feature value logics to treat word order in a single formalism with a rigorous semantics without phrase structure rules.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The elimination of phrase structure rules allows a natural generalisation of the approach to nonconfigurational word order and bounded discontinuous continuency via sequence union.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Sequence union formalises the notions of clause union and scrambling by providing a mechanism for describing word order domains larger than the local tree. The formalism incorporates the distinction between bounded and unbounded forms of discontinuous constituency. Grammars are organised as algebraic theories. This means that linguistic generalisations are stated as axioms about the structure of signs. This permits a natural interpretation of implicational universals in terms of theories, subtheories and implicational axioms. The accompanying linguistic analysis is eclectic, borrowing insights from many current linguistic theories.</Paragraph>
