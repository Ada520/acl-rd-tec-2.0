ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe HARC, a system for speech understanding that integrates speech recognition techniques with natural language processing. The integrated system uses statistical pattern recognition to build a lattice of potential words in the input speech. This word lattice is passed to a unification parser to derive all possible associated syntactic structures for these words. The resulting parse structures are passed to a multi-level semantics component for interpretation.</Paragraph>
