Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe a framework for research into translation that draws on a combination of two existing and independently constructed technologies: an analysis component developed for German by the EUROTRA-D (ET-D) group of IAI and the generation component developed for English by the Penman group at ISI. We present some of the linguistic implications of the research and the promise it bears for furthering understanding of the translation process.</Paragraph>
