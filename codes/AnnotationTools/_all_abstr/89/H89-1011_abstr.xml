</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The BBN BYBLOS continuous speech recognition system has been used to develop a method of speaker adaptation from limited training. The key step in the method is the estimation of a probabilistic spectral mapping between a prototype speaker, for whom there exists a well-trained speaker-dependent hidden Markov model (HMM), and a target speaker for whom there is only a small amount of training speech available. The mapping defines a set of transformation matrices which are used to modify the parameters of the prototype model. The resulting transformed model is then used as an approximation to a well-trained model for the target speaker. We review the techniques employed to accomplish this transformation and present experimental results conducted on the DARPA Resource Management database.</Paragraph>
