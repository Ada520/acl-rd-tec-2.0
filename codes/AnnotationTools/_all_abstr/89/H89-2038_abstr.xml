ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A semi-continuous hidden Markov model based on the muluple vector quantization codebooks is used here for large.vocabulary speaker-independent continuous speech recognition in the techn,ques employed here. the semi-continuous output probab~hty densHy function for each codebook is represented by a comhinat,on of the corre,~ponding discrete output probablhttes of the hidden Markov model end the continuous Gauss,an den.</Paragraph>
