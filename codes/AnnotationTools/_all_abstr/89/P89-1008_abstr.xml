CONVERSATIONALLY RELEVANT DESCRIPTIONS
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Conversationally relevant descriptions are definite descriptions that are not merely tools for the identification of a referent, but are also crucial to the discourse in other respects. I analyze the uses of such descriptions in assertions as conveying a particular ~ype of conversational implicatures. Such implicstures can be represented within the framework of possible world semantics. The analysis is extended to non-assertive illocutionary acts on the one hand, and to indefinite descriptions on the other.</Paragraph>
