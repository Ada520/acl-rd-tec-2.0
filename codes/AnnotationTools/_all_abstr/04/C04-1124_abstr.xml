Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we investigate the multiword verbs in the English sublanguage of MEDLINE abstracts. Based on the integration of the domain-specific named entity knowledge and syntactic as well as statistical information, this work mainly focuses on how to evaluate a proper multiword verb candidate. Our results present a sound balance between the low- and high-frequency multiword verb candidates in the sublanguage corpus. We get a F-measure of 0.753, when tested on a manual sample subset consisting of multiword candidates with both low- and high-frequencies.</Paragraph>
