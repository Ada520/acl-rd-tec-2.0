Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Discourse in formal domains, such as mathematics, is characterized by a mixture of telegraphic natural language and embedded (semi-)formal symbolic mathematical expressions. Due to the lack of empirical data, little is known about the suitability of input analysis methods for mathematical discourse in a dialog setting. We present an input understanding method for a tutoring system teaching mathematical theorem proving. The adopted deep analysis strategy is motivated by the complexity of the language phenomena observed in a corpus collected in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. Our goal is a uniform input interpretation, in particular, considering different degrees of formality of natural language verbalizations.</Paragraph>
