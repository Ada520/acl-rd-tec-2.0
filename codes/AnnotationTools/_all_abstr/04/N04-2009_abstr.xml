Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a system for constructing conceptual graph representation of text by using a combination of existing linguistic resources (VerbNet and WordNet). We use a two-step approach, by firstly identifying the semantic roles in a sentence, and then using these roles, together with semi-automatically compiled domain-specific knowledge to construct the conceptual graph representation.</Paragraph>
