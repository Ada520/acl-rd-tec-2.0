Abstract
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a statistical
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for inferring meaning from a text. Existing LSA-based applications focus on formative assessment in general domains. The suitability of LSA for summative assessment in the domain of computer science is not well known. The results from the pilot study reported in this paper encourage us to pursue further research in the use of LSA in the narrow, technical domain of computer science.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper explains the theory behind LSA, describes some existing LSA applications, and presents some results using LSA for automatic marking of short essays for a graduate class in architectures of computing systems.</Paragraph>
