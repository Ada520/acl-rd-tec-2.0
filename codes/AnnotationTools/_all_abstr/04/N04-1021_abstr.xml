Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a methodology for rapid experimentation in statistical machine translation which we use to add a large number of features to a baseline system exploiting features from a wide range of levels of syntactic representation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Feature values were combined in a log-linear model to select the highest scoring candidate translation from an n-best list. Feature weights were optimized directly against the BLEU evaluation metric on held-out data. We present results for a small selection of features at each level of syntactic representation.</Paragraph>
