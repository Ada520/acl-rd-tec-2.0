</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports on completed work carried out in the framework of the INTERA project, and specifically, on the production of multilingual resources (LRs) for eContent purposes. The paper presents the methodology adopted for the development of the corpus (acquisition and processing of the textual data), discusses the divergence of the initial assumptions from the actual situation met during this procedure, and concludes with a summarization of the problems attested which undermine the viability of multilingual parallel corpora construction.</Paragraph>
