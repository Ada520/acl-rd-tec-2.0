Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present the first algorithm that computes optimal orderings of sentences into a locally coherent discourse. The algorithm runs very efficiently on a variety of coherence measures from the literature.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We also show that the discourse ordering problem is NP-complete and cannot be approximated.</Paragraph>
