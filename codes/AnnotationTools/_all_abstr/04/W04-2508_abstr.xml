</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper addresses the pragmatic challenges that state-of-the-art question/answering systems face in trying to decompose complex information-seeking scenarios. We propose that question decomposition can be approached in one of two ways: either by approximating the domain-specific knowledge for a particular set of domains, or by identifying the decomposition strategies employed by human users. We also present preliminary results from experiments that confirm the viability of each of these approaches within an interactive Q/A context.</Paragraph>
