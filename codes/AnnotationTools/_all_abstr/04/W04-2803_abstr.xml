Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present an evaluation of Carmel-Tools, a novel behavior oriented approach to authoring and maintaining domain specific knowledge sources for robust sentence-level language understanding.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Carmel-Tools provides a layer of abstraction between the author and the knowledge sources, freeing up the author to focus on the desired language processing behavior that is desired in the target system rather than the linguistic details of the knowledge sources that would make this behavior possible. Furthermore, Carmel-Tools offers greater flexibility in output representation than the context-free rewrite rules produced by previous semantic authoring tools, allowing authors to design their own predicate language representations.</Paragraph>
