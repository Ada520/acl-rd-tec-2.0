Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> I show that the semantic structure for discourses, understood as a dependency representation, can be mathematically characterized as DAGs, but these DAGs present heavy structural constraints. The argumentation is based on a simple case, i.e. discourses with three clauses and two discourse connectives. I show that only four types of DAGs are needed for these discourses.</Paragraph>
