Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The inherent robustness of a system might be an important prerequisite for an incremental parsing model to the e ect that grammaticality requirements on full sentences may be suspended or allowed to be violated transiently. However, we present additional means that allow the grammarian to model pre x-analyses by altering a grammar for non-incremental parsing in a controlled way. This is done by introducing underspeci ed dependency edges that model the expected relation between already seen and yet unseen words during parsing. Thus the basic framework of weighted constraint dependency parsing is extended by the notion of dynamic dependency parsing.</Paragraph>
