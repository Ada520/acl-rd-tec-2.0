Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we propose a novel approach for ontology alignment and domain ontology extraction from the existing knowledge bases, WordNet and HowNet. These two knowledge bases are aligned to construct a bilingual ontology based on the co-occurrence of the words in the sentence pairs of a parallel corpus. The bilingual ontology has the merit that it contains more structural and semantic information coverage from these two complementary knowledge bases. For domain-specific applications, the domain specific ontology is further extracted from the bilingual ontology by the island-driven algorithm and the domain-specific corpus. Finally, the domain-dependent terminologies and some axioms between domain terminologies are integrated into the ontology. For ontology evaluation, experiments were conducted by comparing the benchmark constructed by the ontology engineers or experts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can extract an aligned bilingual domain-specific ontology.</Paragraph>
