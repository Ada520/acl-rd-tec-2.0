Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Our motivation is to perform call routing of utterances without recourse to transcriptions of the training data, which are very expensive to obtain. We therefore use phonetic recognition of utterances and search for salient phonetic sequences within the decodings. An important issue in phonetic recognition is the language model. It has been demonstrated [1] that the use of an iterative language model gives benefits in speech recognition performance that are translated to improvements in utterance classification. However, an all-purpose language model sometimes produces decodings that are ambiguous, in that they apparently contain key phonetic sequences from several different routes, or non-informative, in that they apparently contain no useful phonetic sequences. This paper describes a method that uses multiple language models to detect useful information in such utterances. The outputs from recognizers that use these multiple models are examined by post-processing HMMs that decide whether putative sequences are present or not. It is found that using multiple language models increases performance significantly by classifying utterances that a single language model is unable to discriminate.</Paragraph>
