Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Several computational simulations have been proposed for how children solve the word segmentation problem, but most have been tested only on a limited number of languages, often only English. In order to extend the cross-linguistic dimension of word segmentation research, a finite-state framework for testing various models of word segmentation is sketched, and a very simple cue is tested in this framework. Data is taken from Modern Greek, a language with phonological patterns distinct from English. A small-scale simulation shows using this cue performs significantly better than chance. The utility and flexibility of the finite-state approach is confirmed; suggestions for improvement are noted and directions for future work outlined.</Paragraph>
