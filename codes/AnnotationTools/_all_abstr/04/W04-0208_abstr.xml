Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Getting a machine to understand human narratives has been a classic challenge for NLP and AI. This paper proposes a new representation for the temporal structure of narratives. The representation is parsimonious, using temporal relations as surrogates for discourse relations. The narrative models, called Temporal Discourse Models, are treestructured, where nodes include abstract events interpreted as pairs of time points and where the dominance relation is expressed by temporal inclusion. Annotation examples and challenges are discussed, along with a report on progress to date in creating annotated corpora.</Paragraph>
