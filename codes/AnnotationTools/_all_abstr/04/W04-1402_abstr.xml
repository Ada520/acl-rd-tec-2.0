</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> CESTA, the first European Campaign dedicated to MT Evaluation, is a project labelled by the French Technolangue action.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> CESTA provides an evaluation of six commercial and academic MT systems using a protocol set by an international panel of experts. CESTA aims at producing reusable resources and information about reliability of the metrics. Two runs will be carried out: one using the system's basic dictionary, another after terminological adaptation. Evaluation task, test material, resources, evaluation measures, metrics, will be detailed in the full paper. The protocol is the combination of a contrastive reference to: IBM &amp;quot;BLEU&amp;quot; protocol (Papineni, K., S. Roukos, T. Ward and Z. Wei-Jing, 2001); &amp;quot;BLANC&amp;quot; protocol derived from (Hartley, Rajman, 2002).; &amp;quot;ROUGE&amp;quot; protocol (Babych, Hartley, Atwell, 2003). The results of the campaign will be published in a final report and be the object of two intermediary and final workshops.</Paragraph>
