Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In a real-world setting, questions are not asked in isolation, but rather in a cohesive manner that involves a sequence of related questions to meet user's information needs.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The capability to interpret and answer questions based on context is important. In this paper, we discuss the role of discourse modeling in context question answering. In particular, we motivate a semantic-rich discourse representation and discuss the impact of refined discourse structure on question answering.</Paragraph>
