Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In order to control the quality of internet-based language corpora, we developed a method to verify automatically that texts are of (near-) native quality. For the LOCNESS and ICLE corpora, the method is rather successful in separating native and non-native learner texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The Equal Error Rate is about 10%. However, for other domains, such as internet texts, separate classifiers have to be trained on the basis of suitable seed corpora.</Paragraph>
