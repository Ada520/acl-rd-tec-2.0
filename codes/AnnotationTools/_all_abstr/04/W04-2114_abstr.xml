Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a project to develop a lexicon for use both as an electronic dictionary and as a database for a range of NLP tasks. It proposes that a lexicon for such open-ended application may be derived from a human-user dictionary, retaining and enhancing the richness of its editorial content but abandoning its entry-list structure in favour of networks of relationships between discrete lexical objects, where each object represents a discrete lexeme-meaning unit.</Paragraph>
