</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses some main difficulties of restricted-domain question-answering systems, in particular the problem of precision performance. We propose methods for improving the precision, which can be classified into two main approaches: improving the Information Retrieval module, and improving its results. We present the application of these methods in a real QA system for a large company, which yielded very good results.</Paragraph>
