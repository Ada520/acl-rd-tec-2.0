</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe the extraction of thesaurus information from parsed dictionary de nition sentences. The main data for our experiments comes from Lexeed, a Japanese semantic dictionary, and the Hinoki treebank built on it. The dictionary is parsed using a head-driven phrase structure grammar of Japanese. Knowledge is extracted from the semantic representation (Minimal Recursion Semantics). This makes the extraction process language independent. null</Paragraph>
