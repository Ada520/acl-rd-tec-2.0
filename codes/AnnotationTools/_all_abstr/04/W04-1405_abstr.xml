<Paragraph position="0"> The aim of the paper is to present an Open Source Learning Management System for creating courses in translation theory and practice. Some of its most important characteristics are:  * Full user logging and tracking - activity reports for each student are available * Mail integration - copies of forum posts and teacher feedback can be mailed * Assignment Module with due date and grade requirements  The training includes the use of corpora (monoand bilingual) and TM tools, with tasks ranging from alignment of texts and creating a translation memory, to terminology extraction from specialized comparable language corpora and other translation projects.</Paragraph>
