Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we discuss the applicability of the knowledge representation and reasoning language AnsProlog for the design and implementation of query answering systems. We consider a motivating example, and illustrate how AnsProlog can be used to represent defaults, causal relations, and other types of common-sense knowledge needed to properly answer non-trivial questions about the example's domain. null</Paragraph>
