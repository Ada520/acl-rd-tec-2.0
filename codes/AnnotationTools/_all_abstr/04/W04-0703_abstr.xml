Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Event clustering on streaming news aims to group documents by events automatically.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper employs co-reference chains to extract the most representative sentences, and then uses them to select the most informative features for clustering. Due to the long span of events, a fixed threshold approach prohibits the latter documents to be clustered and thus decreases the performance. A dynamic threshold using time decay function and spanning window is proposed. Besides the noun phrases in co-reference chains, event words in each sentence are also introduced to improve the related performance. Two models are proposed. The experimental results show that both event words and co-reference chains are useful on event clustering.</Paragraph>
