Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper shows how to construct semantic representations from the derivations produced by a wide-coverage CCG parser. Unlike the dependency structures returned by the parser itself, these can be used directly for semantic interpretation. We demonstrate that well-formed semantic representations can be produced for over 97% of the sentences in unseen WSJ text.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We believe this is a major step towards wide-coverage semantic interpretation, one of the key objectives of the field of NLP.</Paragraph>
