</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper investigates the use of concept-based representations for text categorization. We introduce a new approach to create concept-based text representations, and apply it to a standard text categorization collection. The representations are used as input to a Support Vector Machine classifier, and the results show that there are certain categories for which concept-based representations constitute a viable supplement to word-based ones. We also demonstrate how the performance of the Support Vector Machine can be improved by combining representations.</Paragraph>
