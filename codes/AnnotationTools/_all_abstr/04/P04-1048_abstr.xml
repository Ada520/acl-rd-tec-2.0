Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents SemFrame, a system that induces frame semantic verb classes from WordNet and LDOCE. Semantic frames are thought to have significant potential in resolving the paraphrase problem challenging many language-based applications.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> When compared to the handcrafted FrameNet, SemFrame achieves its best recall-precision balance with 83.2% recall (based on SemFrame's coverage of FrameNet frames) and 73.8% precision (based on SemFrame verbs' semantic relatedness to frame-evoking verbs). The next best performing semantic verb classes achieve 56.9% recall and 55.0% precision.</Paragraph>
