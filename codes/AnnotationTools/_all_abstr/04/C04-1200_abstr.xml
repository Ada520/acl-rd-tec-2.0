<Paragraph position="0"> Identifying sentiments (the affective parts of opinions) is a challenging problem. We present a system that, given a topic, automatically finds the people who hold opinions about that topic and the sentiment of each opinion. The system contains a module for determining word sentiment and another for combining sentiments within a sentence. We experiment with various models of classifying and combining sentiment at word and sentence levels, with promising results.</Paragraph>
