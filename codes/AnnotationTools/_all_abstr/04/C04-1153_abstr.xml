Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Imbalanced training sets, where one class is heavily underrepresented compared to the others, have a bad effect on the classification of rare class instances. We apply One-sided Sampling for the first time to a lexical acquisition task (learning verb complements from Modern Greek corpora) to remove redundant and misleading training examples of verb non-dependents and thereby balance our training set. We experiment with well-known learning algorithms to classify new examples. Performance improves up to 22% in recall and 15% in precision after balancing the dataset  .</Paragraph>
