Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we address the issue of user-adaptivity for annotation guidelines. We show that different user groups have different needs towards these documents, a fact neglected by most of current annotation guidelines. We propose a formal specification of the structure of annotation guidelines, thus suggesting a minimum set of requirements that guidelines should fulfill. Finally, we sketch the use of these specifications by exemplary applications, resulting in user-specific guideline representations.</Paragraph>
