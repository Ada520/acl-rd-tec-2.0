Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe a resource-light system for the automatic morphological analysis and tagging of Russian. We eschew the use of extensive resources (particularly, large annotated corpora and lexicons), exploiting instead (i) pre-existing annotated corpora of Czech; (ii) an unannotated corpus of Russian. We show that our approach has benefits, and present what we believe to be one of the first full evaluations of a Russian tagger in the openly available literature.</Paragraph>
