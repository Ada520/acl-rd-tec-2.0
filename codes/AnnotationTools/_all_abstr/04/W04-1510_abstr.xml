</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces the new grammar formalism of Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG), and emphasizes the benefits of its methodology of explaining complex phenomena by interaction of simple principles on multiple dimensions of linguistic description. This has the potential to increase modularity with respect to linguistic description and grammar engineering, and to facilitate concurrent processing and the treatment of ambiguity.</Paragraph>
