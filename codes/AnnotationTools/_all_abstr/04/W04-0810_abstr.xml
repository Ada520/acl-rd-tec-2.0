Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a first experience with evaluating sytems that address the issue of Logic Form Identification (LFi). A Gold Standard approach was used in which experts provide solutions to test data.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The expert solutions, the gold standard, are then compared against outputs from participanting systems and different metrics observed. We proposed a few novel metrics, including precision and recall, that are further used to provide comparative results.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The test data included 4155 arguments and 2398 predicates grouped in 300 sentences.</Paragraph>
