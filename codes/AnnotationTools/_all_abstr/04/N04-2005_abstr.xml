Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The translation of English text into American Sign Language (ASL) animation tests the limits of traditional MT architectural designs.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A new semantic representation is proposed that uses virtual reality 3D scene modeling software to produce spatially complex ASL phenomena called &amp;quot;classifier predicates.&amp;quot; The model acts as an interlingua within a new multi-pathway MT architecture design that also incorporates transfer and direct approaches into a single system.</Paragraph>
