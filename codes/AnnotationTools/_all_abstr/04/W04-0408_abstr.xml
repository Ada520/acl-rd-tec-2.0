Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose to model multiword expressions as dependency subgraphs, and realize this idea in the grammar formalism of Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG). We extend XDG to lexicalize dependency subgraphs, and show how to compile them into simple lexical entries, amenable to parsing and generation with the existing XDG constraint solver.</Paragraph>
