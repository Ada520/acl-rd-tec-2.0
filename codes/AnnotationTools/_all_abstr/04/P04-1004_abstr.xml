Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Discourse in formal domains, such as mathematics, is characterized by a mixture of telegraphic natural language and embedded (semi-)formal symbolic mathematical expressions. We present language phenomena observed in a corpus of dialogs with a simulated tutorial system for proving theorems as evidence for the need for deep syntactic and semantic analysis. We propose an approach to input understanding in this setting. Our goal is a uniform analysis of inputs of different degree of verbalization: ranging from symbolic alone to fully worded mathematical expressions.</Paragraph>
