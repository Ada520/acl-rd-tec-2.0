Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Definition questions represent a largely unexplored area of question answering--they are different from factoid questions in that the goal is to return as many relevant &amp;quot;nuggets&amp;quot; of information about a concept as possible.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We describe a multi-strategy approach to answering such questions using a database constructed offline with surface patterns, a Web-based dictionary, and an off-the-shelf document retriever. Results are presented from component-level evaluation and from an end-to-end evaluation of our implemented system at the TREC 2003 Question Answering Track.</Paragraph>
