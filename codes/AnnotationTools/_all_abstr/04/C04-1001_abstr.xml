Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper addresses the documentation of large-scale grammars.1 We argue that grammar implementation differs from ordinary software programs: the concept of modules, as known from software engineering, cannot be transferred directly to grammar implementations, due to grammar-specific properties. These properties also put special constraints on the form of grammar documentation. To fulfill these constraints, we propose an XML-based, grammar-specific documentation technique.</Paragraph>
