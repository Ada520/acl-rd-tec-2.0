Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents AsdeCopas, a module designed to interface syntax and semantics. AsdeCopas is based on hierarchically organised semantic rules, that output formulas in a flat language. In this paper, we show how this system can be used in the following applications: a) semantic disambiguation; b) logical formulas construction (in Minimal Recursion Semantics); c) question interpretation.</Paragraph>
