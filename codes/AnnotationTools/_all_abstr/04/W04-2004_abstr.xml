Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The goal of this article is to present our work about a combination of several syntactic parsers to produce a more robust parser. We have built a platform which allows us to compare syntactic parsers for a given language by splitting their results in elementary pieces, normalizing them, and comparing them with reference results. The same platform is used to combine several parsers to produce a dependency parser that has larger coverage and is more robust than its component parsers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In the future, it should be possible to &amp;quot;compile&amp;quot; the knowledge extracted from several analyzers into an autonomous dependency parser.</Paragraph>
