Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents work on the task of constructing an example base  from a given bi-lingual corpus based on the annotation schema of Translation Corresponding Tree (TCT). Each TCT describes a translation example (a pair of bilingual sentences). It represents the syntactic structure of source language sentence, and more importantly is the facility to specify the correspondences between string (both the source and target sentences) and the representation tree.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Furthermore, syntax transformation clues are also encapsulated at each node in the TCT representation to capture the differentiation of grammatical structure between the source and target languages. With this annotation schema, translation examples are effectively represented and organized in the bilingual knowledge database that we need for the Portuguese to Chinese machine translation system. null</Paragraph>
