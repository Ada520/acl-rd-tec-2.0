Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> It is known that context words tend to be selftriggers, that is, the probability of a content word to appear more than once in a document, given that it already appears once, is significantly higher than the probability of the first occurrence. We look at self-triggerability across hyperlinks on the Web. We show that the probability of a word a6a8a7 to appear in a Web document a9a11a10 depends on the presence of a6a12a7 in documents pointing to a9a13a10 . In Document Modeling, we will propose the use of a correction factor, a14 , which indicates how much more likely a word is to appear in a document given that another document containing the same word is linked to it.</Paragraph>
