</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports experiments in classifying texts based upon their favorability towards the subject of the text using a feature set enriched with topic information on a small dataset of music reviews hand-annotated for topic. The results of these experiments suggest ways in which incorporating topic information into such models may yield improvement over models which do not use topic information.</Paragraph>
