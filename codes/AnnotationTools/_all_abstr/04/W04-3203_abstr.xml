Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Most statistical parsers have used the grammar induction approach, in which a stochastic grammar is induced from a treebank. An alternative approach is to induce a controller for a given parsing automaton. Such controllers may be stochastic; here, we focus on greedy controllers, which result in deterministic parsers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We use decision trees to learn the controllers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The resulting parsers are surprisingly accurate and robust, considering their speed and simplicity. They are almost as fast as current part-of-speech taggers, and considerably more accurate than a basic unlexicalized PCFG parser. We also describe Markov parsing models, a general framework for parser modeling and control, of which the parsers reported here are a special case.</Paragraph>
