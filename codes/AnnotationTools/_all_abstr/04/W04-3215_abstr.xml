Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Accurate dependency recovery has recently been reported for a number of wide-coverage statistical parsers using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). However, overall figures give no indication of a parser's performance on specific constructions, nor how suitable a parser is for specific applications. In this paper we give a detailed evaluation of a CCG parser on object extraction dependencies found in WSJ text.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We also show how the parser can be used to parse questions for Question Answering. The accuracy of the original parser on questions is very poor, and we propose a novel technique for porting the parser to a new domain, by creating new labelled data at the lexical category level only. Using a supertagger to assign categories to words, trained on the new data, leads to a dramatic increase in question parsing accuracy.</Paragraph>
