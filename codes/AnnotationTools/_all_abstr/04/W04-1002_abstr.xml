Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Information graphics (non-pictorial graphics such as bar charts or line graphs) are an important component of multimedia documents. Often such graphics convey information that is not contained elsewhere in the document. Thus document summarization must be extended to include summarization of information graphics. This paper addresses our work on graphic summarization. It argues that the message that the graphic designer intended to convey must play a major role in determining the content of the summary, and it outlines our approach to identifying this intended message and using it to construct the summary.</Paragraph>
