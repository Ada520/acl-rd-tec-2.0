Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present new results on the relation between context-free parsing strategies and their probabilistic counter-parts. We provide a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the probabilistic extension of parsing strategies. These results generalize existing results in the literature that were obtained by considering parsing strategies in isolation.</Paragraph>
