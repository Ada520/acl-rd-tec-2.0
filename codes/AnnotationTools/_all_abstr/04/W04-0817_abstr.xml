Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a system for semantic role assignment built as part of the Senseval III task, based on an off-the-shelf parser and Maxent and Memory-Based learners. We focus on generalisation using several similarity measures to increase the amount of training data available and on the use of EM-based clustering to improve role assignment. Our final score is Precision=73.6%, Recall=59.4% (F=65.7).</Paragraph>
