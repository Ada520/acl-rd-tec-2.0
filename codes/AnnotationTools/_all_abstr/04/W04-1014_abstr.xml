Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Automatic summaries of text generated through sentence or word extraction has been evaluated by comparing them with manual summaries generated by humans by using numerical evaluation measures based on precision or accuracy. Although sentence extraction has previously been evaluated based only on precision of a single sentence, sentence concatenations in the summaries should be evaluated as well. We have evaluated the appropriateness of sentence concatenations in summaries by using evaluation measures used for evaluating word concatenations in summaries through word extraction. We determined that measures considering sentence concatenation much better reflect the human judgment rather than those based only on the precision of a single sentence.</Paragraph>
