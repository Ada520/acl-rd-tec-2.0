Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a syntax-semantics interface that realises the mapping between syntax and semantics as a relation and does not make functionality assumptions in either direction. This interface is stated in terms of Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG), a grammar formalism we newly specify. XDG's constraint-based parser supports the concurrent flow of information between any two levels of linguistic representation, even when only partial analyses are available. This generalises the concept of underspecification. null</Paragraph>
