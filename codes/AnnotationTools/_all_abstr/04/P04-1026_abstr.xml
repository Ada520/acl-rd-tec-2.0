Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A new technique is introduced, linguistic profiling, in which large numbers of counts of linguistic features are used as a text profile, which can then be compared to average profiles for groups of texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The technique proves to be quite effective for authorship verification and recognition. The best parameter settings yield a False Accept Rate of 8.1% at a False Reject Rate equal to zero for the verification task on a test corpus of student essays, and a 99.4% 2-way recognition accuracy on the same corpus.</Paragraph>
