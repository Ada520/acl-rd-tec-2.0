Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe an extension of the Wysiwym technology for knowledge editing through natural language feedback. Previous applications have addressed relatively simple tasks requiring a very limited range of nominal and clause patterns. We show that by adding a further editing operation called reconfiguration, the technology can achieve a far wider coverage more in line with other general-purpose generators. The extension will be included in a Java-based library package for producing Wysiwym applications.</Paragraph>
