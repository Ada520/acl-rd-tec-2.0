Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we show that an unsupervised method for ranking word senses automatically can be used to identify infrequently occurring senses. We demonstrate this using a ranking of noun senses derived from the BNC and evaluating on the sense-tagged text available in both SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We show that the method does well at identifying senses that do not occur in a corpus, and that those that are erroneously filtered but do occur typically have a lower frequency than the other senses. This method should be useful for word sense disambiguation systems, allowing effort to be concentrated on more frequent senses; it may also be useful for other tasks such as lexical acquisition.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Whilst the results on balanced corpora are promising, our chief motivation for the method is for application to domain specific text. For text within a particular domain many senses from a generic inventory will be rare, and possibly redundant. Since a large domain specific corpus of sense annotated data is not available, we evaluate our method on domain-specific corpora and demonstrate that sense types identified for removal are predominantly senses from outside the domain.</Paragraph>
