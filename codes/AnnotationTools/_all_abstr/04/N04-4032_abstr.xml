</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The lack of sentence boundaries and presence of disfluencies pose difficulties for parsing conversational speech. This work investigates the effects of automatically detecting these phenomena on a probabilistic parser's performance. We demonstrate that a state-of-the-art segmenter, relative to a pause-based segmenter, gives more than 45% of the possible error reduction in parser performance, and that presentation of interruption points to the parser improves performance over using sentence boundaries alone.</Paragraph>
