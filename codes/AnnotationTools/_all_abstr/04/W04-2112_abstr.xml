The dictionary has been on-line for the past five years and has been frequently visited by the Internet users. We evaluate and discuss the system based on the analysis of the collected data about site visits during this five-year period. The dictionary structure is inspired by the WordNet basic design. The dictionary's source knowledge base and the software system provide interfaces to producing an on-line dictionary, a printed-paper dictionary, and several electronic resources useful in Natural Language Processing.</Paragraph>
