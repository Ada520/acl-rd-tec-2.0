<Paragraph position="0"> Spec is a critical issue for automatic chunking.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper proposes a solution of Chinese chunking with another type of spec, which is not derived from a complete syntactic tree but only based on the un-bracketed, POS tagged corpus. With this spec, a chunked data is built and HMM is used to build the chunker. TBL-based error correction is used to further improve chunking performance. The average chunk length is about 1.38 tokens, F measure of chunking achieves 91.13%, labeling accuracy alone achieves 99.80% and the ratio of crossing brackets is 2.87%. We also find that the hardest point of Chinese chunking is to identify the chunking boundary inside</Paragraph>
