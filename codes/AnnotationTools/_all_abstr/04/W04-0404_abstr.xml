Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a method for compositionally translating noun-noun (NN) compounds, using a word-level bilingual dictionary and syntactic templates for candidate generation, and corpus and dictionary statistics for selection. We propose a support vector learning-based method employing target language corpus and bilingual dictionary data, and evaluate it over a Englisha0 Japanese machine translation task.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We show the proposed method to be superior to previous methods and also robust over low-frequency NN compounds.</Paragraph>
