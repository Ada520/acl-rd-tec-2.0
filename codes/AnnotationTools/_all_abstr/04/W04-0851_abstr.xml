Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper describes RLSC-LIN and RLSC-COMB systems which participated in the Senseval-3 English lexical sample task. These systems are based on Regularized Least-Squares Classification (RLSC) learning method. We describe the reasons of choosing this method, how we applied it to word sense disambiguation, what results we obtained on Senseval1, Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 data and discuss some possible improvements.</Paragraph>
