</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A novel challenge for evaluating open-domain question answering technologies is proposed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this challenge, question answering systems are supposed to be used interactively to answer a series of related questions, whereas in the conventional setting, systems answer isolated questions one by one. Such an interaction occurs in the case of gathering information for a report on a specific topic, or when browsing information of interest to the user. In this paper, first, we explain the design of the challenge. We then discuss its reality and show how the capabilities measured by the challenge are useful and important in practical situations, and that the difficulty of the challenge is proper for evaluating the current state of open-domain question answering technologies.</Paragraph>
