Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce a character-based chunking for unknown word identification in Japanese text. A major advantage of our method is an ability to detect low frequency unknown words of unrestricted character type patterns. The method is built upon SVM-based chunking, by use of character n-gram and surrounding context of n-best word segmentation candidates from statistical morphological analysis as features.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It is applied to newspapers and patent texts, achieving 95% precision and 55-70% recall for newspapers and more than 85% precision for patent texts.</Paragraph>
