Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a comparative analysis of relative clauses in Hindi and Arabic in the tradition of the Paninian Grammar Framework (Bharati et al., 1996b) which leads to deriving a common logical form for equivalent sentences. Parallels are drawn between the Hindi co-relative construction and resumptive pronouns in Arabic. The analysis arises from the development of lexicalised dependency grammars for Hindi and Arabic that have application for machine translation.</Paragraph>
