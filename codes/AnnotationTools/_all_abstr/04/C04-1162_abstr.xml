Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a new open text word sense disambiguation method that combines the use of logical inferences with PageRank-style algorithms applied on graphs extracted from natural language documents. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm on several sense-annotated texts, and show that it consistently outperforms the accuracy of other previously proposed knowledge-based word sense disambiguation methods. We also explore and evaluate methods that combine several open-text word sense disambiguation algorithms.</Paragraph>
