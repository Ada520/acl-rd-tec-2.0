Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we introduce a large-scale test collection for multiple document summarization, the Text Summarization Challenge 3 (TSC3) corpus. We detail the corpus construction and evaluation measures. The significant feature of the corpus is that it annotates not only the important sentences in a document set, but also those among them that have the same content. Moreover, we define new evaluation metrics taking redundancy into account and discuss the effectiveness of redundancy minimization.</Paragraph>
