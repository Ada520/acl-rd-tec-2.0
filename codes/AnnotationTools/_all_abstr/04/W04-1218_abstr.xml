Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we report the adaptation of a named entity recognition (NER) system to the biomedical domain in order to participate in the &amp;quot;Shared Task Bio-Entity Recognition&amp;quot;. The system is originally developed for German NER that shares characteristics with the biomedical task. To facilitate adaptability, the system is knowledge-poor and utilizes unlabeled data. Investigating the adaptability of the single components and the enhancements necessary, we get insights into the task of bio-entity recognition.</Paragraph>
