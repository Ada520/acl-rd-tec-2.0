Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper reports on the behaviour of a Kohonen map of the mental lexicon, monitored through different phases of acquisition of the Italian verb system. Reported experiments appear to consistently reproduce emergent global ordering constraints on memory traces of inflected verb forms, developed through principles of local interactions between parallel processing neurons.</Paragraph>
