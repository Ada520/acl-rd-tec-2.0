Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a series of simulations of behavioral data by casting a simple parsing model in the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We show that constraints defined in ACT-R, specifically those relating to activation, can account for a range of facts about human sentence processing. In doing so, we argue that resource limitation in working memory is better defined as an artefact of very general and independently motivated principles of cognitive processing. null</Paragraph>
