Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe an approach to text planning that uses the XSLT template-processing engine to create logical forms for an external surface realizer. Using a realizer that can process logical forms with embedded alternatives provides a substitute for backtracking in the text-planning process. This allows the text planner to combine the strengths of the AI-planning and template-based traditions in natural language generation.</Paragraph>
