Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In the framework of projects ChinFaDial and ERIM we have developed in recent years several platforms allowing to handle various aspects of bilingual spoken dialogues on the web --mainly, spontaneous speech corpus collection through distant human interpreting.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Current development of the core ERIM-Interp and ERIM-Collect platforms now includes multimodal user interaction, integration of some machine aids (such as speech turn logs through speech recognition, or tentatively speech machine translation, both based on server-grounded market products), and next, online aids to speakers and/or interpreters.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> First collected data should be made available on the web in fall 2004 (DistribDial) along with, as soon as available, a robust version of the collecting platform, in order to promote collaborative building, and sharing, of &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; unannotated multilingual speech corpora.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> A variant of the ERIM environment is to extend to distant e-training in interpreting, possibly creating situations which should in turn, in our view, foster larger-scale data collection and sharing in open access mode.</Paragraph>
