</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, the search engine Intuition is described. It allows the user to navigate through the documents retrieved with a given query. Several &amp;quot;browse help&amp;quot; functions are provided by the engine and described here: conceptualisation, named entities, similar documents and entity visualization. They intend to &amp;quot;save the user's time&amp;quot;. In order to evaluate the amount of time these features can save, an evaluation was made. It involves 6 users, 18 queries and the corpus is made of 16 years of the newspaper Le Monde. The results show that, with the different features, a user get faster to the needed information. fewer non-relevant documents are read (filtering) and more relevant documents are retrieved in less time.</Paragraph>
