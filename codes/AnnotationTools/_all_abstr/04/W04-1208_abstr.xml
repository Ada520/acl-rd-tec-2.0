Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Biological databases contain facts from scientific literature, which have been curated by hand to ensure high quality. Curation is time-consuming and can be supported by information extraction methods. We present a server which identifies biological facts in scientific text and presents the annotation to the curator.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Such facts are: UniProt, UMLS and GO terminology, identification of gene and protein names, mutations and protein-protein interactions. UniProt, UMLS and GO concepts are automatically linked to the original source. The module for mutations is based on syntax patterns and the one for protein-protein interactions on NLP. All modules work independently of each other in single threads and are combined in a pipeline to ensure proper meta data integration. For fast response time the modules are distributed on a Linux cluster. The server is at present available to curation teams of biomedical data and will be opened to the public in the future.</Paragraph>
