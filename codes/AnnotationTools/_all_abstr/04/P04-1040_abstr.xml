Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a method for enriching the output of a parser with information available in a corpus. The method is based on graph rewriting using memory-based learning, applied to dependency structures.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This general framework allows us to accurately recover both grammatical and semantic information as well as non-local dependencies. It also facilitates dependency-based evaluation of phrase structure parsers. Our method is largely independent of the choice of parser and corpus, and shows state of the art performance.</Paragraph>
