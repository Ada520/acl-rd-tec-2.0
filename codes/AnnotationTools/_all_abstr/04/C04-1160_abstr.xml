<Paragraph position="0"> (modestly named the Neural Theory of Language) that is attempting to model language behavior in a way that is both neurally plausible and computationally practical. The cornerstone of the effort is a formalism called Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG). I will describe the formalism, a robust semantic parser based on it, and a variety of applications of moderate scale. These include a system for understanding the (probabilistic and metaphorical) implications of news stories, and the first cognitively plausible model of how children learn grammar.</Paragraph>
