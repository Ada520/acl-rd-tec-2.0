1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we interpret the semantic role labeling problem as a classification task, and apply memory-based learning to it in an approach similar to Buchholz et al.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> (1999) and Buchholz (2002) for grammatical relation labeling. We apply feature selection and algorithm parameter optimization strategies to our learner. In addition, we investigate the effect of two innovations: (i) the use of sequences of classes as classification output, combined with a simple voting mechanism, and (ii) the use of iterative classifier stacking which takes as input the original features and a pattern of outputs of a first-stage classifier.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Our claim is that both methods avoid errors in sequences of predictions typically made by simple classifiers that are unaware of their previous or subsequent decisions in a sequence.</Paragraph>
