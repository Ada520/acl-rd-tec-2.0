Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper shows how talking robots can be built from off-the-shelf components, based on the Lego MindStorms robotics platform. We present four robots that students created as final projects in a seminar we supervised. Because Lego robots are so affordable, we argue that it is now feasible for any dialogue researcher to tackle the interesting challenges at the robot-dialogue interface.</Paragraph>
