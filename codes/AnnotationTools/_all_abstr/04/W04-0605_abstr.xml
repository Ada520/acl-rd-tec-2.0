Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This talk will introduce the W3C Multimodal Interaction Activity, whose goal is to design a framework of specifications to enable access to the Web using multi-modal interaction. In particular we will introduce the Extensible MultiModal Annotation (EMMA) language specification. EMMA is an XML language for describing the interpretation of user input, combining transcriptions of raw signals into words with metadata to help applications resolve uncertainties and contradictions in interpretations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We will also discuss the issues encountered by the Working Group as the language is being developed, such as whether to use RDF or not, how best to combine interpretations, or what metadata properties to represent.</Paragraph>
