Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> WordNet::Similarity is a freely available software package that makes it possible to measure the semantic similarity and relatedness between a pair of concepts (or synsets). It provides six measures of similarity, and three measures of relatedness, all of which are based on the lexical database WordNet. These measures are implemented as Perl modules which take as input two concepts, and return a numeric value that represents the degree to which they are similar or related.</Paragraph>
