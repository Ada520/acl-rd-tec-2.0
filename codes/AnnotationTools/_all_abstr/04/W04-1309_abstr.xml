Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces a system that simulates the transition from the one-word stage to the two-word stage in child language production.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Two-word descriptions are syntactically generated and compete against one-word descriptions from the outset. Two-word descriptions become dominant as word combinations are repeatedly recognised, forming syntactic categories; resulting in an emergent simple syntax. The system demonstrates a similar maturation as children as evidenced by phenomena such as overextensions and mismatching, and the use of one-word descriptions being replaced by two-word descriptions over time.</Paragraph>
