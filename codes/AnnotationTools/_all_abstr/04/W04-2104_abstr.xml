Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Lexical resources are key components for applications related to human language technology. Various models of lexical resources have been designed and implemented during the last twenty years and the scientific community has now gained enough experience to design a common standard at an international level. This paper thus describes the ongoing activity within ISO/TC 37/SC 4 on LMF (Lexical Markup Framework) and shows how it can be concretely implemented for the design of an on-line morphological resource for French in the Morphalou project.</Paragraph>
