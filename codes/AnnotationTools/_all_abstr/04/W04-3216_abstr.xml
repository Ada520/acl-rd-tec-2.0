Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a model for creating word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between documents and their human written abstracts. Such alignments are critical for the development of statistical summarization systems that can be trained on large corpora of document/abstract pairs. Our model, which is based on a novel Phrase-Based HMM, outperforms both the Cut &amp; Paste alignment model (Jing, 2002) and models developed in the context of machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).</Paragraph>
