Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper looks at how Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources can be deployed in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) materials for primary school learners. We draw a broad distinction between CL and NLP technology and briefly review the use of CL/NLP in e-Learning in general, how it has been deployed in CALL to date and specifically in the primary school context. We outline how CL/NLP resources can be used in a project to teach Irish and German to primary school children in Ireland. This paper focuses on the use of Finite State morphological analysis (FST) resources for Irish and Part of Speech (POS) taggers for German.</Paragraph>
