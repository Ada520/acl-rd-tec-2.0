</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> NLP methods and applications need to take account not only of &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; lexical relations, as found in WordNet, but the lessstructural, more context-dependent &amp;quot;non-classical&amp;quot; relations that readers intuit in text. In a reader-based study of lexical relations in text, most were found to be of the latter type.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The relationships themselves are analyzed, and consequences for NLP are discussed.</Paragraph>
