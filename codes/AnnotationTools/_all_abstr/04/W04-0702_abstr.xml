Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> By combining information extraction and record linkage techniques, we have created a repository of references to attorneys, judges, and expert witnesses across a broad range of text sources. These text sources include news, caselaw, law reviews, Medline abstracts, and legal briefs among others. We briefly describe our cross document co-reference resolution algorithm and discuss applications these resolved references enable. Among these applications is one that shows summaries of relationships chains between individuals based on their document co-occurrence and cross document co-references.</Paragraph>
