Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present the dialogue-understanding components of an architecture for assisting multi-human conversations in artifact-producing meetings: meetings in which tangible products such as project planning charts are created. Novel aspects of our system include multimodal ambiguity resolution, modular ontology-driven artifact manipulation, and a meeting browser for use during and after meetings.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We describe the software architecture and demonstrate the system using an example multimodal dialogue.</Paragraph>
