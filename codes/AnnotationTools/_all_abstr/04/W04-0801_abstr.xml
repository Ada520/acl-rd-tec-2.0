Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe the Senseval 3 Basque lexical sample task. The task comprised 40 words (15 nouns, 15 verbs and 10 adjectives) selected from the Basque WordNet. 10 of the words were chosen in coordination with other lexical-sample tasks. The examples were taken from newspapers, an in-house balanced corpus and Internet texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We additionally included a large set of untagged examples, and a lemmatised version of the data including lemma, PoS and case information. The method used to hand-tag the examples produced an inter-tagger agreement of 78.2% before arbitration. The eight competing systems attained results well above the most frequent baseline and the best system from Swarthmore College scored 70.4% recall.</Paragraph>
