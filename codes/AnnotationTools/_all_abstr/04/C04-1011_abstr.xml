Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We consider the problem of computing the Kullback-Leibler distance, also called the relative entropy, between a probabilistic context-free grammar and a probabilistic nite automaton. We show that there is a closed-form (analytical) solution for one part of the Kullback-Leibler distance, viz.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> the cross-entropy. We discuss several applications of the result to the problem of distributional approximation of probabilistic context-free grammars by means of probabilistic nite automata.</Paragraph>
