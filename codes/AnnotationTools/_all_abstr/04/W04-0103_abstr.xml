Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Schwa deletion is an important issue in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for Indo-Aryan languages (IAL). In this paper, we describe a syllable minimization based algorithm for dealing with this that outperforms the existing methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that deletion of schwa is a diachronic and sociolinguistic phenomenon that facilitates faster communication through syllable economy. The contribution of the paper is not just a better algorithm for schwa deletion; rather we describe here a constrained optimization based framework that can partly model the evolution of languages, and hence, can be used for solving many problems in computational linguistics that call for diachronic explanations.</Paragraph>
