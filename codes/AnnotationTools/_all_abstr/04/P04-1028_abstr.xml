Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes and evaluates MOP, an IE system for automatic extraction of metalinguistic information from technical and scientific documents. We claim that such a system can create special databases to bootstrap compilation and facilitate update of the huge and dynamically changing glossaries, knowledge bases and ontologies that are vital to modern-day research.</Paragraph>
