Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We report that a proper employment of MWEs concerned enables us to put forth a tractable framework, which is based on a multiple nesting of semantic operations, for the processing of non-inferential, Non-propositional Contents (NPCs) of natural Japanese sentences. Our framework is characterized by its broad syntactic and semantic coverage, enabling us to deal with multiply composite modalities and their semantic/pragmatic similarity. Also, the relationship between indirect (Searle, 1975) and direct speech, and equations peculiar to modal logic and its family (Mally, 1926; Prior, 1967) are treated in the similarity paradigm.</Paragraph>
