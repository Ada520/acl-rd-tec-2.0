Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Currently, information architects create meta-data category hierarchies manually. We present a nearly-automated approach for deriving such hierarchies, by converting the lexical hierarchy WordNet into a format that reflects the contents of a target information collection. We use the term &amp;quot;nearly-automated&amp;quot; because an information architect should have to make only small adjustments to produce an acceptable metadata structure. We contrast the results with an algorithm that uses lexical co-occurrence statistics.</Paragraph>
