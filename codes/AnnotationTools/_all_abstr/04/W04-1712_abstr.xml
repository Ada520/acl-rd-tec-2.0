Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a new e-learning paradigm which enables the user to type in arbitrary sentences.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The current NLP technologies, however, are not matured enough to perform full-automatic semantic or discourse analysis. Thus, we take a di erent approach; an instructor corrects the contents and its correction is embedded into the contents in an XML format called KeML. The key/mouse operations of the user are also embedded as annotations. Thus, the contents can be incomplete at the initial stage and become solid gradually as being utilized. We have implemented an e-learning system of group discussion for a foreign language class, which is demonstrated at the workshop.</Paragraph>
