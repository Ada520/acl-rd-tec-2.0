Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes and evaluates the use of linguistic information in the pre-processing phase of text mining tasks. We present several experiments comparing our proposal for selection of terms based on linguistic knowledge with usual techniques applied in the field. The results show that part of speech information is useful for the pre-processing phase of text categorization and clustering, as an alternative for stop words and stemming.</Paragraph>
