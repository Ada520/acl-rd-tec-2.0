Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Supervised estimation methods are widely seen as being superior to semi and fully unsupervised methods. However, supervised methods crucially rely upon training sets that need to be manually annotated. This can be very expensive, especially when skilled annotators are required. Active learning (AL) promises to help reduce this annotation cost. Within the complex domain of HPSG parse selection, we show that ideas from ensemble learning can help further reduce the cost of annotation. Our main results show that at times, an ensemble model trained with randomly sampled examples can outperform a single model trained using AL. However, converting the single-model AL method into an ensemble-based AL method shows that even this much stronger baseline model can be improved upon. Our best results show a a2a4a3a6a5 reduction in annotation cost compared with single-model random sampling.</Paragraph>
