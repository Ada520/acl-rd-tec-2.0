Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes two decision trees for determining the meanings of the prepositional uses of over by using the contextual information. It first examines the meanings of the prepositional uses of over and then aims at identifying the contexts for interpreting the meanings. Some contexts are complementary features, and that makes the decision trees simple. The trees have been tested on a corpus, and the results are encouraging.</Paragraph>
