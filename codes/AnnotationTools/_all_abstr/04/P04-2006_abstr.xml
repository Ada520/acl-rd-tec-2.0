Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Paraphrase recognition is used in a number of applications such as tutoring systems, question answering systems, and information retrieval systems. The context of our research is the iSTART reading strategy trainer for science texts, which needs to understand and recognize the trainee's input and respond appropriately. This paper describes the motivation for paraphrase recognition and develops a definition of the strategy as well as a recognition model for paraphrasing. Lastly, we discuss our preliminary implementation and research plan.</Paragraph>
