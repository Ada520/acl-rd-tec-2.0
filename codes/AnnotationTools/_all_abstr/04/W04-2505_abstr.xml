Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we introduce two methods for deriving the intentional structure of complex questions. Techniques that enable the derivation of implied information are also presented. We show that both the intentional structure and the implicatures enabled by it are essential components of Q/A systems capable of successfully processing complex questions. The results of our evaluation support the claim that there are multiple interactions between the process of answer finding and the coercion of intentions and implicatures.</Paragraph>
