Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Sentiment analysis seeks to identify the viewpoint(s) underlying a text span; an example application is classifying a movie review as &amp;quot;thumbs up&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;thumbs down&amp;quot;. To determine this sentiment polarity, we propose a novel machine-learning method that applies text-categorization techniques to just the subjective portions of the document. Extracting these portions can be implemented using efficient techniques for finding minimum cuts in graphs; this greatly facilitates incorporation of cross-sentence contextual constraints.</Paragraph>
