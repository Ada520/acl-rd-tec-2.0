</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we are concerned with identifying the topics of sentences in Chinese texts. The key elements of the centering model of local discourse coherence are employed to identify the topic which is the most salient element in a Chinese sentence. Due to the phenomenon of zero anaphora occurring in Chinese texts frequently, in addition to the centering model, we further employ the constraint rules to identify the antecedents of zero anaphors. Unlike most traditional approaches to parsing sentences based on the integration of complex linguistic information and domain knowledge, we work on the output of a part-of-speech tagger and use shallow parsing instead of complex parsing to identify the topics from sentences.</Paragraph>
