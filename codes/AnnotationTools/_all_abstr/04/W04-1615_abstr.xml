</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> FarsiSum is an attempt to create an automatic text summarization system for Persian. The system is implemented as a HTTP client/server application written in Perl. It uses modules implemented in an existing summarizer geared towards the Germanic languages, a Persian stop-list in Unicode format and a small set of heuristic rules.</Paragraph>
