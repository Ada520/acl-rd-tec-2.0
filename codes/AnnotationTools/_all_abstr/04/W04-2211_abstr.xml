<Paragraph position="0"> This paper addresses a new method of constructing Korean-Chinese verb patterns from existing patterns. A verb pattern is a subcategorization frame of a predicate extended by translation information. Korean-Chinese verb patterns are invaluable linguistic resources that a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9 only used for Korean-Chinese transfer but also for Korean parsing. Usually a verb pattern has been either hand-coded by expert lexicographers or extracted automatically from bilingual corpus. In the first case, the dependence on the linguistic intuition of lexicographers may lead to the incompleteness and the inconsistency of a dictionary. In the second case, extracted patterns can be domain-dependent. In this paper, we present a method to construct Korean-Chinese verb patterns semi-automatically from existing Korean-Chinese verb patterns that are manually written by lexicographers.</Paragraph>
