Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper evaluates the accuracy of HPSG parsing in terms of the identification of predicate-argument relations. We could directly compare the output of HPSG parsing with Prop-Bank annotations, by assuming a unique mapping from HPSG semantic representation into PropBank annotation. Even though PropBank was not used for the training of a disambiguation model, an HPSG parser achieved the accuracy competitive with existing studies on the task of identifying PropBank annotations.</Paragraph>
