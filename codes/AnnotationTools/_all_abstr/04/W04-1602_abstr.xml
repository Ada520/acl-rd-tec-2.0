Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we address the following questions from our experience of the last two and a half years in developing a large-scale corpus of Arabic text annotated for morphological information, part-of-speech, English gloss, and syntactic structure: (a) How did we 'leapfrog' through the stumbling blocks of both methodology and training in setting up the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) annotation? (b) How did we reconcile the Penn Treebank annotation principles and practices with the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) traditional and more recent grammatical concepts? (c) What are the current issues and nagging problems? (d) What has been achieved and what are our future expectations?</Paragraph>
