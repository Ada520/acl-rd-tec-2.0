Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a method for evaluating interannotator reliability in an email corpus annotated for type (e.g., question, answer, social chat) when annotators are allowed to assign multiple labels to a message. An augmentation is proposed to Cohen's kappa statistic which permits all data to be included in the reliability measure and which further permits the identification of more or less reliably annotated data points.</Paragraph>
