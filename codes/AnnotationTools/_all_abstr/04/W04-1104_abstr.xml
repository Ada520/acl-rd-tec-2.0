Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This article presents a compression-based adaptive algorithm for Chinese Pinyin input. There are many different input methods for Chinese character text and the phonetic Pinyin input method is the one most commonly used.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Compression by Partial Match (PPM) is an adaptive statistical modelling technique that is widely used in the field of text compression. Compression-based approaches are able to build models very efficiently and incrementally.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Experiments show that adaptive compression-based approach for Pinyin input outperforms modified Kneser-Ney smoothing method implemented by SRILM language tools (Stolcke, 2002).</Paragraph>
