Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Summarizing threads of email is different from summarizing other types of written communication as it has an inherent dialog structure. We present initial research which shows that sentence extraction techniques can work for email threads as well, but profit from email-specific features. In addition, the presentation of the summary should take into account the dialogic structure of email communication.</Paragraph>
