Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In the five years since it was proposed, the MATE scheme for anaphoric annotation has been used in a variety of annotation projects, and the resulting corpora have been used to study both anaphora resolution and NL generation. Annotation tools inspired by the proposals have been used in some of these projects. In this paper we discuss these first experiences with the scheme, some lessons that have been learned, and suggest a few modifications.</Paragraph>
