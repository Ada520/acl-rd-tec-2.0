Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe the analytic question answering system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive Question Answering) which has been developed over the last 2 years as an advanced research tool for information analysts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> HITIQA is an interactive open-domain question answering technology designed to allow analysts to pose complex exploratory questions in natural language and obtain relevant information units to prepare their briefing reports. The system uses novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clarification dialogue with the user that explores the scope and the context of the desired answer space. The system has undergone extensive hands-on evaluations by a group of intelligence analysts representing various foreign intelligence services. This evaluation validated the overall approach in HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the current prototype.</Paragraph>
