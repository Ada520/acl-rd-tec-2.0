Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Sino-Korean words, which are historically borrowed from Chinese language, could be represented with both Hanja (Chinese characters) and Hangeul (Korean characters) writings. Previous Korean Input Method Editors (IMEs) provide only a simple dictionary-based approach for Hangeul-Hanja conversion. This paper presents a sentence-based statistical model for Hangeul-Hanja conversion, with word tokenization included as a hidden process. As a result, we reach 91.4% of character accuracy and 81.4% of word accuracy in terminology domain, when only very limited Hanja data is available.</Paragraph>
