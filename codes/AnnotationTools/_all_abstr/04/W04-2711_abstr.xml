Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The Valency Lexicon of Czech Verbs, Version 1.0 (VALLEX 1.0) is a collection of linguistically annotated data and documentation, resulting from an attempt at formal description of valency frames of Czech verbs. VALLEX 1.0 is closely related to Prague Dependency Treebank. In this paper, the context in which VALLEX came into existence is briefly outlined, and also three similar projects for English verbs are mentioned. The core of the paper is the description of the logical structure of the VALLEX data. Finally, we suggest a few directions of the future research.</Paragraph>
