We show that this extension gives additional information about evaluated texts; in particular it allows us to measure translation Adequacy, which, for statistical MT systems, is often overestimated by the baseline BLEU method. The proposed model uses a single human reference translation, which increases the usability of the proposed method for practical purposes. The model suggests a linguistic interpretation which relates frequency weights and human intuition about translation Adequacy and Fluency.</Paragraph>
