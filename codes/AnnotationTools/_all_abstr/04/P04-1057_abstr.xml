Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Parsing systems which rely on hand-coded linguistic descriptions can only perform adequately in as far as these descriptions are correct and complete.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The paper describes an error mining technique to discover problems in hand-coded linguistic descriptions for parsing such as grammars and lexicons. By analysing parse results for very large unannotated corpora, the technique discovers missing, incorrect or incomplete linguistic descriptions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The technique uses the frequency of n-grams of words for arbitrary values of n. It is shown how a new combination of suffix arrays and perfect hash finite automata allows an efficient implementation.</Paragraph>
