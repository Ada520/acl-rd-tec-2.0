Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a method to extract foreign words, such as technical terms and proper nouns, from Korean corpora and produce a Japanese-Korean bilingual dictionary. Specific words have been imported into multiple countries simultaneously, if they are influential across cultures. The pronunciation of a source word is similar in different languages. Our method extracts words in Korean corpora that are phonetically similar to Katakana words, which can easily be identified in Japanese corpora. We also show the effectiveness of our method by means of experiments.</Paragraph>
