Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes using RDF/RDFS/XML to create and navigate a metadata model of relationships among entities in text. The metadata we create is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the content being modeled, it provides the end-user with context sensitive information about the hyperlinked entities in focus. These entities at the core of the model are originally found and resolved using a combination of information extraction and record linkage techniques. The RDF/RDFS meta-data model is then used to look ahead and navigate to related information. An RDF aware front-end web application streamlines the presentation of information to the end user.</Paragraph>
