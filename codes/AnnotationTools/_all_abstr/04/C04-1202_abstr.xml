Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we consider the automatic text summarization as a challenging task of machine learning. We proposed a novel summarization system architecture which employs Gene Expression Programming technique as its learning mechanism. The preliminary experimental results have shown that our prototype system outperforms the baseline systems.</Paragraph>
