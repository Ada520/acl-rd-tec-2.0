Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We use machine learners trained on a combination of acoustic confidence and pragmatic plausibility features computed from dialogue context to predict the accuracy of incoming n-best recognition hypotheses to a spoken dialogue system. Our best results show a 25% weighted f-score improvement over a baseline system that implements a &amp;quot;grammar-switching&amp;quot; approach to context-sensitive speech recognition.</Paragraph>
