Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This article studies the resolution of references made by speakers to documents discussed during a meeting. The focus is on transcribed recordings of press review meetings, in French. After an overview of the required framework for reference resolution--specification of the task, data annotation, and evaluation procedure--we propose, analyze and evaluate an algorithm for the resolution of references to documents (ref2doc) based on anaphora tracking and context matching. Applications to speech-to-document alignment and more generally to meeting processing and retrieval are finally discussed.</Paragraph>
