Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a data and error analysis for semantic role labelling. In a first experiment, we build a generic statistical model for semantic role assignment in the FrameNet paradigm and show that there is a high variance in performance across frames. The main hypothesis of our paper is that this variance is to a large extent a result of differences in the underlying argument structure of the predicates in different frames. In a second experiment, we show that frame uniformity, which measures argument structure variation, correlates well with the performance figures, effectively explaining the variance.</Paragraph>
