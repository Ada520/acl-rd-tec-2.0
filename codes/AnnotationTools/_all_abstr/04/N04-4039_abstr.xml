Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a method for assigning gestures to text based on lexical and syntactic information. First, our empirical study identified lexical and syntactic information strongly correlated with gesture occurrence and suggested that syntactic structure is more useful for judging gesture occurrence than local syntactic cues. Based on the empirical results, we have implemented a system that converts text into an animated agent that gestures and speaks synchronously.</Paragraph>
