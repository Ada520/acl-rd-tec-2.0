Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a grammar formalism that combines the insights from Combinatory Categorial Grammar with feature structure uni cation. We show how information structure can be incorporated with syntactic and semantic representations in a principled way. We focus on the way theme, rheme, and focus are integrated in the compositional semantics, using Discourse Representation Theory as rst-order semantic theory. UCCG can be used for parsing and generating prosodically annotated text, and therefore has the potential to advance spoken dialogue systems.</Paragraph>
