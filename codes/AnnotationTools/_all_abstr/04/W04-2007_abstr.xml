Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The UNL project (Universal Networking Language) proposes a standard for encoding the meaning of natural language utterances as semantic hypergraphs, intended to be used as pivot in multilingual information and communication systems. Several deconverters permit to automatically translate UNL utterances into natural languages. However, a rough enconvertion from natural language texts to UNL expressions is usually done interactively with editors specially designed for the UNL project or by hand (which is very time-consuming and difficult to extrapolate to huge amounts of data).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, we address the issue of using an existing incremental robust parser as main resource to enconverting French utterances into UNL expressions.</Paragraph>
