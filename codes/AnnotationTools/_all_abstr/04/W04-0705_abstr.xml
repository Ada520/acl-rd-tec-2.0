</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a novel method of applying the results of coreference resolution to improve Name Recognition for Chinese. We consider first some methods for gauging the confidence of individual tags assigned by a statistical name tagger. For names with low confidence, we show how these names can be filtered using coreference features to improve accuracy. In addition, we present rules which use coreference information to correct some name tagging errors. Finally, we show how these gains can be magnified by clustering documents and using cross-document coreference in these clusters. These combined methods yield an absolute improvement of about 3.1% in tagger F score.</Paragraph>
