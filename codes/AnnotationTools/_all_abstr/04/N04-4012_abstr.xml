</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> UI on the Fly is a system that dynamically presents coordinated multimodal content through natural language and a small-screen graphical user interface. It adapts to the user's preferences and situation.

Faithful variants are scored with a heuristic function.</Paragraph>
