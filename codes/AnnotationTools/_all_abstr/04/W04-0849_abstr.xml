Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the NMSU-Pitt-UNCA word-sense disambiguation system participating in the Senseval-3 English lexical sample task. The focus of the work is on using semantic class-based collocations to augment traditional word-based collocations. Three separate sources of word relatedness are used for these collocations: 1) WordNet hypernym relations; 2) cluster-based word similarity classes; and 3) dictionary definition analysis.</Paragraph>
