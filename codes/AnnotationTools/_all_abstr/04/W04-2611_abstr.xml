Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We explore a semantic abstraction approach to automatic summarization in the biomedical domain. The approach relies on a semantic processor that functions as the source interpreter and produces a list of predications. A transformation stage then generalizes and condenses this list, ultimately generating a conceptual condensate for a disorder input topic. The final condensate is displayed in graphical form. We provide a set of principles for the transformation stage and describe the application of this approach to multidocument input. Finally, we examine the characteristics and quality of the condensates produced.</Paragraph>
