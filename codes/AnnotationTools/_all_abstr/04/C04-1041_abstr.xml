Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the role of supertagging in a wide-coverage CCG parser which uses a log-linear model to select an analysis. The supertagger reduces the derivation space over which model estimation is performed, reducing the space required for discriminative training.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It also dramatically increases the speed of the parser. We show that large increases in speed can be obtained by tightly integrating the supertagger with the CCG grammar and parser.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> This is the first work we are aware of to successfully integrate a supertagger with a full parser which uses an automatically extracted grammar.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> We also further reduce the derivation space using constraints on category combination. The result is an accurate wide-coverage CCG parser which is an order of magnitude faster than comparable systems for other linguistically motivated formalisms.</Paragraph>
