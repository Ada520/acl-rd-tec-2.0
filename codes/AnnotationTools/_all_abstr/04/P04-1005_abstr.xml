Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a noisy channel model of speech repairs, which can identify and correct repairs in speech transcripts. A syntactic parser is used as the source model, and a novel type of TAG-based transducer is the channel model.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The use of TAG is motivated by the intuition that the reparandum is a \rough copy&amp;quot; of the repair. The model is trained and tested on the Switchboard dis uency-annotated corpus.</Paragraph>
