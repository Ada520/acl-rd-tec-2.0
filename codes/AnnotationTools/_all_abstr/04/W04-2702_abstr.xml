Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Mapping between syntax and semantics is one of the most promising research topics in corpus annotation. This paper deals with the implementation of an semi-automatic transformation from a syntactically-tagged corpus into a semantic-tagged one. The method has been experimentally applied to a 1600-sentence treebank (the UAM Spanish Treebank). Results of evaluation are provided as well as prospective work in comparing syntax and semantics in written and spoken annotated corpora.</Paragraph>
