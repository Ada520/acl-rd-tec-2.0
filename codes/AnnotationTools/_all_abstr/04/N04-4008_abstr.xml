Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a method of automatically constructing an English-Chinese bilingual FrameNet where the English FrameNet lexical entries are linked to the appropriate Chinese word senses. This resource can be used in machine translation and cross-lingual IR systems. We coerce the English FrameNet into Chinese using a bilingual lexicon, frame context in FrameNet and taxonomy structure in HowNet.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our approach does not require any manual mapping between FrameNet and HowNet semantic roles. Evaluation results show that we achieve a promising 82% average F-measure for the most ambiguous lexical entries.</Paragraph>
