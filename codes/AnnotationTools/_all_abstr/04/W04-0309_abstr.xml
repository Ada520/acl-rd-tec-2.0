Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> When an incremental parser gets the next word, its expectations about upcoming grammatical structures can change. When a word greatly constrains these grammatical expectations, uncertainty is reduced. This elimination of possibilities constitutes information processing work. Formalizing this notion of information processing work yields a complexity metric that predicts human repetition accuracy scores across a systematic class of linguistic phenomena, the Accessibility Hierarchy of relativizable grammatical relations.</Paragraph>
