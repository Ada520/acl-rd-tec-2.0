Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Knowledge of the anaphoricity of a noun phrase might be profitably exploited by a coreference system to bypass the resolution of non-anaphoric noun phrases. Perhaps surprisingly, recent attempts to incorporate automatically acquired anaphoricity information into coreference systems, however, have led to the degradation in resolution performance.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper examines several key issues in computing and using anaphoricity information to improve learning-based coreference systems. In particular, we present a new corpus-based approach to anaphoricity determination. Experiments on three standard coreference data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</Paragraph>
