Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present the current state of development of a large-scale lexicon built at LabEL1 for Portuguese. We will concentrate on multiword expressions (MWE), particularly on multiword nouns, (i) illustrating their most relevant morphological features, and (ii) pointing out the methods and techniques adopted to generate the inflected forms from lemmas. Moreover, we describe a corpus-based aproach for the acquisition of new multiword nouns, which led to a significant enlargement of the existing lexicon.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Evaluation results concerning lexical coverage in the corpus are also discussed.</Paragraph>
