<Paragraph position="0"> Word alignment is a challenging task aiming at the identification of translational relations between words and multi-word units in parallel corpora. Many alignment strategies are based on links between single words. Different strategies can be used to find the optimal word alignment using such one-to-one word links including relations between multi-word units. In this paper seven algorithms are compared using a word alignment approach based on association clues and an English-Swedish bitext together with a handcrafted reference alignment used for evaluation.</Paragraph>
