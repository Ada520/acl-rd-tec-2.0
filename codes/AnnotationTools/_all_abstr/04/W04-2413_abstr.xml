Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a statistical approach to semantic role labelling that employs only shallow information. We use a Maximum Entropy learner, augmented by EM-based clustering to model the fit between a verb and its argument candidate. The instances to be classified are sequences of chunks that occur frequently as arguments in the training corpus. Our best model obtains an F score of 51.70 on the test set.</Paragraph>
