Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> VINCI is a Natural Language Generation environment designed for use in computer-aided second language instruction. It dynamically generates multiple parallel trees representing an initial text, questions on this text, and expected answers, and either orthographic or phonetic output. Analyses of a learner's answers to questions are used to diagnose comprehension and language skills and to adaptively control subsequent generation. The paper traces stages in the generation of short texts in English and French, and discusses issues of architecture, textual enrichment, and planning.</Paragraph>
