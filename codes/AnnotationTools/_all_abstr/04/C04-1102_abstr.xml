Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a detection method for orthographic variants caused by transliteration in a large corpus. The method employs two similarities. One is string similarity based on edit distance. The other is contextual similarity by a vector space model. Experimental results show that the method performed a 0.889 F-measure in an open test.</Paragraph>
