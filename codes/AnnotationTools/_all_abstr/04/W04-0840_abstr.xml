Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Logic Forms, particular powerful logic representations presented in Moldovan and Rus (2001), are simple yet highly effective. In this paper, the structure of Logic Forms and their generation from input text are described. The results of an evaluation comparing the Logic Forms generated by hand with those generated automatically are also reported. Finally, we suggest some improvements to the representation used in the LFI task based on our results.</Paragraph>
