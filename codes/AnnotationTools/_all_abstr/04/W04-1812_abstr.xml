Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The purpose of the study is to develop an integrated knowledge management system for the domains of genome and nano-technology, in which terminology-based literature mining, knowledge acquisition, knowledge structuring, and knowledge retrieval are combined. The system supports integrating different databases (papers and patents, technologies and innovations) and retrieving different types of knowledge simultaneously. The main objective of the system is to facilitate knowledge acquisition from documents and new knowledge discovery through a terminology-based similarity calculation and a visualization of automatically structured knowledge. Implementation issues of the system are also mentioned.</Paragraph>
