Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a disambiguation method in which word senses are determined using a dictionary. We use a semantic proximity measure between words in the dictionary, taking into account the whole topology of the dictionary, seen as a graph on its entries. We have tested the method on the problem of disambiguation of the dictionary entries themselves, with promising results considering we do not use any prior annotated data.</Paragraph>
