Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper I outline Type-inheritance Combinatory Categorial Grammar (TCCG), an implemented feature structure based CCG fragment of English. TCCG combines the fully lexical nature of CCG with the type-inheritance hierarchies and complex feature structures of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammars (HPSG).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The result is a CCG/HPSG hybrid that combines linguistic generalizations previously only statable in one theory or the other, even extending the set of statable generalizations to those not easily captured by either theory.</Paragraph>
