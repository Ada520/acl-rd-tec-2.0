Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes several ongoing projects that are united by the theme of changes in lexical use over time. We show that paying attention to a document's temporal context can lead to improvements in information retrieval and text categorization. We also explore a potential application in document clustering that is based upon different types of lexical changes.</Paragraph>
