Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we address the question of assigning semantic roles to sentences in Chinese. We show that good semantic parsing results for Chinese can be achieved with a small 1100-sentence training set. In order to extract features from Chinese, we describe porting the Collins parser to Chinese, resulting in the best performance currently reported on Chinese syntactic parsing; we include our headrules in the appendix. Finally, we compare English and Chinese semantic-parsing performance. While slight differences in argument labeling make a perfect comparison impossible, our results nonetheless suggest significantly better performance for Chinese. We show that much of this difference is due to grammatical differences between English and Chinese, such as the prevalence of passive in English, and the strict word order constraints on adjuncts in Chinese.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph position="2"> We first describe our creation of a small 1100-sentence Chinese corpus labeled according to principles from the English and (in-progress) Chinese PropBanks. We then introduce the features used by our SVM classifier, and show their performance on semantic parsing for both seen and unseen verbs, given hand-corrected (Chinese TreeBank) syntactic parses. We then describe our port of the Collins (1999) parser to Chinese. Finally, we apply our SVM semantic parser to a matching English corpus, and discuss the differences between English and Chinese that lead to significantly better performance on Chinese.</Paragraph>
