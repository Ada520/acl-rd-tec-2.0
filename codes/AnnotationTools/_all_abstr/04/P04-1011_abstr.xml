Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A challenging problem for spoken dialog systems is the design of utterance generation modules that are fast, exible and general, yet produce high quality output in particular domains.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A promising approach is trainable generation, which uses general-purpose linguistic knowledge automatically adapted to the application domain. This paper presents a trainable sentence planner for the MATCH dialog system. We show that trainable sentence planning can produce output comparable to that of MATCH's template-based generator even for quite complex information presentations.</Paragraph>
