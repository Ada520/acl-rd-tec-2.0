Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An ef cient bit-vector-based CKY-style parser for context-free parsing is presented. The parser computes a compact parse forest representation of the complete set of possible analyses for large treebank grammars and long input sentences. The parser uses bit-vector operations to parallelise the basic parsing operations. The parser is particularly useful when all analyses are needed rather than just the most probable one.</Paragraph>
