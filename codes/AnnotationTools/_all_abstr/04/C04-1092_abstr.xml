</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a versatile system intended to acquire paraphrastic phrases from a representative corpus. In order to decrease the time spent on the elaboration of resources for NLP system (for example Information Extraction, IE hereafter), we suggest to use a knowledge acquisition module that helps extracting new information despite linguistic variation (textual entailment). This knowledge is automatically derived from the text collection, in interaction with a large semantic network.</Paragraph>
