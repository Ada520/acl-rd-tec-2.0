1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe the Spanish Lexical Sample task. This task was initially devised for evaluating the role of unlabeled examples in supervised and semi-supervised learning systems for WSD and it was coordinated with five other lexical sample tasks (Basque, Catalan, English, Italian, and Rumanian) in order to share part of the target words.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Firstly, we describe the methodology followed to develop the linguistic resources necessary for the task: the MiniDir-2.1 lexicon and the MiniCors corpus. Secondly, we summarize the participant systems, the results obtained, and a comparative analysis. Participant systems include pure supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning.</Paragraph>
