Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This article discusses the detection of discourse markers (DM) in dialog transcriptions, by human annotators and by automated means. After a theoretical discussion of the definition of DMs and their relevance to natural language processing, we focus on the role of like as a DM. Results from experiments with human annotators show that detection of DMs is a difficult but reliable task, which requires prosodic information from soundtracks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Then, several types of features are defined for automatic disambiguation of like: collocations, part-of-speech tags and duration-based features. Decision-tree learning shows that for like, nearly 70% precision can be reached, with near 100% recall, mainly using collocation filters. Similar results hold for well, with about 91% precision at 100% recall.</Paragraph>
