Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Speech recognition errors are inevitable in a speech dialog system. This paper presents an error handling method based on correction grammars which recognize the correction utterances which follow a recognition error.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Correction grammars are dynamically created from existing grammars and a set of correction templates. We also describe a prototype dialog system which incorporates this error handling method, and provide empirical evidence that this method can improve dialog success rate and reduce the number of dialog turns required for error recovery.</Paragraph>
