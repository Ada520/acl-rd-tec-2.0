Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses several issues in Arabic orthography that were encountered in the process of performing morphology analysis and POS tagging of 542,543 Arabic words in three newswire corpora at the LDC during 2002-2004, by means of the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer. The most important issues involved variation in the orthography of Modern Standard Arabic that called for specific changes to the Analyzer algorithm, and also a more rigorous definition of typographic errors. Some orthographic anomalies had a direct impact on word tokenization, which in turn affected the morphology analysis and assignment of POS tags.</Paragraph>
