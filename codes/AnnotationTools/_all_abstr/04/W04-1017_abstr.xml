Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Most approaches to extractive summarization define a set of features upon which selection of sentences is based, using algorithms independent of the features themselves. We propose a new set of features based on low-level, atomic events that describe relationships between important actors in a document or set of documents. We investigate the effect this new feature has on extractive summarization, compared with a baseline feature set consisting of the words in the input documents, and with state-of-the-art summarization systems. Our experimental results indicate that not only the event-based features offer an improvement in summary quality over words as features, but that this effect is more pronounced for more sophisticated summarization methods that avoid redundancy in the output.</Paragraph>
