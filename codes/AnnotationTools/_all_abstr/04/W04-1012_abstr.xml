</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Summarization evaluation has been always a challenge to researchers in the document summarization field. Usually, human involvement is necessary to evaluate the quality of a summary.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Here we present a new method for automatic evaluation of text summaries by using document graphs. Data from Document Understanding Conference 2002 (DUC-2002) has been used in the experiment. We propose measuring the similarity between two summaries or between a summary and a document based on the concepts/entities and relations between them in the text.</Paragraph>
