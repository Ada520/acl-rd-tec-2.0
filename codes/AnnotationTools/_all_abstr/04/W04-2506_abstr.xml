Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Modern Question/Answering systems rely on expected answer types for processing questions. The answer type is a semantic category provided by Named Entity recognizer or by semantic hierarchies. We argue in this paper that Q/A systems should take advantage of the topic information by exploiting several models of question and answer categorization.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The matching of the question category with the answer category allows the system to filter out many incorrect answers.</Paragraph>
