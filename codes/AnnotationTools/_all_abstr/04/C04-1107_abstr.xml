Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper investigates a novel application of support vector machines (SVMs) for sentence reduction.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We also propose a new probabilistic sentence reduction method based on support vector machine learning. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform earlier methods in term of sentence reduction performance.</Paragraph>
