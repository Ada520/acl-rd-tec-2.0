Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> SenseClusters is a freely available word sense discrimination system that takes a purely unsupervised clustering approach. It uses no knowledge other than what is available in a raw unstructured corpus, and clusters instances of a given target word based only on their mutual contextual similarities. It is a complete system that provides support for feature selection from large corpora, several different context representation schemes, various clustering algorithms, and evaluation of the discovered clusters.</Paragraph>
