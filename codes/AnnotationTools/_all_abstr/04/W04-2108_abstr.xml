Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an original way to add new data in a reference dictionary from several other lexical resources, without loosing any consistence. This operation is carried in order to get lexical information classifled by the sense of the entry. This classiflcation makes it possible to enrich utterances (in QA: the queries) following the meaning, and to reduce noise. An analysis of the experienced problems shows the interest of this method, and insists on the points that have to be tackled.</Paragraph>
