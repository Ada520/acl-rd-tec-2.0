Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper presents a new way of accounting for the meaning of verbs in natural languages, using a diagrammatic notation based on the Uni ed Modeling Language (UML). We will introduce the new framework by outlining some modeling elements and indicating major differences to the UML. An extended example will be discussed in more detail. We will then focus on the cognitive background of the framework, and in particular address the question why the usage of graphical elements within a linguistic modeling language proves to be very fruitful. Finally, we will brie y indicate the potential of the new framework and its applicability.</Paragraph>
