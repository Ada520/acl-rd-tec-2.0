Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a new, large scale discourse-level annotation project - the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB). We present an approach to annotating a level of discourse structure that is based on identifying discourse connectives and their arguments. The PDTB is being built directly on top of the Penn Tree-Bank and Propbank, thus supporting the extraction of useful syntactic and semantic features and providing a richer substrate for the development and evaluation of practical algorithms. We provide a detailed preliminary analysis of inter-annotator agreement - both the level of agreement and the types of inter-annotator variation. null</Paragraph>
