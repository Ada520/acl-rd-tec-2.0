Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The understanding and summarization of stories remains a challenge, in part because of the inability to adequately capture the 'aboutness' of information content. This can result in inappropriate content selection as well as summary incoherence. This talk sketches a general framework for narrative summarization that relies in part on explo itation of temporal information. I will show how this framework can help address the above problems. I go on to discuss how different levels of narrative structure can provide useful information for summarization.</Paragraph>
