<Paragraph position="0"> Answer validation is a component of question answering system, which selects reliable answer from answer candidates extracted by certain methods. In this paper, we propose an approach of answer validation based on the strengths of lexical association between the keywords extracted from a question sentence and each answer candidate. The proposed answer validation process is decomposed into two steps: the first is to extract appropriate keywords from a question sentence using word features and the strength of lexical association, while the second is to estimate the strength of the association between the keywords and an answer candidate based on the hits of search engines. In the result of experimental evaluation, we show that a good proportion (79%) of a multiple-choice quiz &amp;quot;Who wants to be a millionaire&amp;quot; can be solved by the proposed method.</Paragraph>
