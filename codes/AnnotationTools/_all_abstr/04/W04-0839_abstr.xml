Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the SyntaLex entries in the English Lexical Sample Task of SENSEVAL-3.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> There are four entries in all, where each of the different entries corresponds to use of word bigrams or Part of Speech tags as features. The systems rely on bagged decision trees, and focus on using pairs of lexical and syntactic features individually and in combination. They are descendants of the Duluth systems that participated in SENSEVAL-2.</Paragraph>
