Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We investigate a number of simple methods for improving the word-alignment accuracy of IBM Model 1. We demonstrate reduction in alignment error rate of approximately 30% resulting from (1) giving extra weight to the probability of alignment to the null word, (2) smoothing probability estimates for rare words, and (3) using a simple heuristic estimation method to initialize, or replace, EM training of model parameters.</Paragraph>
