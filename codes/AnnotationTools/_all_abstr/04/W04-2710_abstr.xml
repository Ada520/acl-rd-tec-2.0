Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> High-quality lexical resources are needed to both train and evaluate Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems. The problem of ambiguity persists even in limited domains, thus the necessity for wide-coverage inventories of senses (dictionaries) and corpora sense-tagged to them. WordNet has been used extensively for WSD, for both its broad coverage and its large network of semantic relations. In this paper, we present a report on the state of our current endeavor to increase the connectivity of WordNet through sense-tagging the glosses, the result of which will be to create a more integrated lexical resource.</Paragraph>
