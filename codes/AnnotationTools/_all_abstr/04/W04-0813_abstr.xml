Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Our group participated in the Basque and English lexical sample tasks in Senseval-3. A language-specific feature set was defined for Basque. Four different learning algorithms were applied, and also a method that combined their outputs. Before submission, the performance of the methods was tested for each task on the Senseval-3 training data using cross validation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Finally, two systems were submitted for each language: the best single algorithm and the best ensemble.</Paragraph>
