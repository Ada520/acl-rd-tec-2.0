</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper studies a strategy for identifying and using multi-word expressions in Statistical Machine Translation. The performance of the proposed strategy for various types of multi-word expressions (like nouns or verbs) is evaluated in terms of alignment quality as well as translation accuracy. Evaluations are performed by using real-life data, namely the European Parliament corpus. Results from translation tasks from English-to-Spanish and from Spanish-to-English are presented and discussed.</Paragraph>
