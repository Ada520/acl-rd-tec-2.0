Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We report on a study examining the generation of noun phrases within a spoken dialog agent for a navigation domain. The task is to provide real-time instructions that direct the user to move between a series of destinations within a large interior space. A subtask within sentence planning is determining what form to choose for noun phrases. This choice is driven by both the discourse history and spatial context features derived from the directionfollower's position, e.g. his view angle, distance from the target referent and the number of similar items in view. The algorithm was developed as a decision tree and its output was evaluated by a group of human judges who rated 62.6% of the expressions generated by the system to be as good as or better than the language originally produced by human dialog partners.</Paragraph>
