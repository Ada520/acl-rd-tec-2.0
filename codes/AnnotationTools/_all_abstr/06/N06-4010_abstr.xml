Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe the web and mobile-phone interfaces to our multi-language factoid question answering (QA) system together with a prototype speech interface to our English-language QA system. Using a statistical, data-driven approach to factoid question answering has allowed us to develop QA systems in five languages in a matter of months. In the web-based system, which is accessible at http://asked.jp, we have combined the QA system output with standard search-engine-like results by integrating it with an open-source web search engine.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The prototype speech interface is based around a VoiceXML application running on the Voxeo developer platform. Recognition of the user's question is performed on a separate speech recognition server dedicated to recognizing questions. An adapted version of the Sphinx-4 recognizer is used for this purpose. Once the question has been recognized correctly it is passed to the QA system and the resulting answers read back to the user by speech synthesis. Our approach is modular and makes extensive use of open-source software. Consequently, each component can be easily and independently improved and easily extended to other languages. null</Paragraph>
