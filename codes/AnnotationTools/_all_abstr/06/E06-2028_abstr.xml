</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The NLP systems often have low performances because they rely on unreliable and heterogeneous knowledge. We show on the task of non-anaphoric it identification how to overcome these handicaps with the Bayesian Network (BN) formalism. The first results are very encouraging compared with the state-of-the-art systems. null</Paragraph>
