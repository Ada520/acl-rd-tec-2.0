Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an extension to the Reference Domain Theory (Salmon-Alt, 2001) in order to solve plural references.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> While this theory doesn't take plural reference into account in its original form, this paper shows how several entities can be grouped together by building a new domain and how they can be accessed later on. We introduce the notion of super-domain, representing the access structure to all the plural referents of a given type.</Paragraph>
