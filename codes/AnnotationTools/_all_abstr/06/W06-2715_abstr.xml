Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper discusses two topics: firstly an approach of using multiple layers of annotation is sketched out. Regarding the XML representation this approach is similar to standoff annotation. A second topic is the use of heterogeneous linguistic resources (e.g., XML annotated documents, taggers, lexical nets) as a source for semi-automatic multi-dimensional markup to resolve typical linguistic issues, dealing with anaphora resolution as a case study.1</Paragraph>
