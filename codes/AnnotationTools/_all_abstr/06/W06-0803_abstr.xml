Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Assume that you are looking for information about a particular person. A search engine returns many pages for that person's name. Some of these pages may be on other people with the same name.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> One method to reduce the ambiguity in the query and filter out the irrelevant pages, is by adding a phrase that uniquely identifies the person we are interested in from his/her namesakes. We propose an unsupervised algorithm that extracts such phrases from the Web. We represent each document by a term-entity model and cluster the documents using a contextual similarity metric. We evaluate the algorithm on a dataset of ambiguous names. Our method outperforms baselines, achieving over 80% accuracy and significantly reduces the ambiguity in a web search task.</Paragraph>
