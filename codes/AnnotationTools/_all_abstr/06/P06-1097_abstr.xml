Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce a semi-supervised approach to training for statistical machine translation that alternates the traditional Expectation Maximization step that is applied on a large training corpus with a discriminative step aimed at increasing word-alignment quality on a small, manually word-aligned sub-corpus. We show that our algorithm leads not only to improved alignments but also to machine translation outputs of higher quality.</Paragraph>
