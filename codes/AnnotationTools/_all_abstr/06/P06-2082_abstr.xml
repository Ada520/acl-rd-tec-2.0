Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses sampling strategies for building a dependency-analyzed corpus and analyzes them with different kinds of corpora. We used the Kyoto Text Corpus, a dependency-analyzed corpus of newspaper articles, and prepared the IPAL corpus, a dependency-analyzed corpus of example sentences in dictionaries, as a new and different kind of corpus. The experimental results revealed that the length of the test set controlled the accuracy and that the longest-first strategy was good for an expanding corpus, but this was not the case when constructing a corpus from scratch.</Paragraph>
