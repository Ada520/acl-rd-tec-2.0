Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The present paper proposes a method by which to translate outputs of a robust HPSG parser into semantic representations of Typed Dynamic Logic (TDL), a dynamic plural semantics defined in typed lambda calculus. With its higher-order representations of contexts, TDL analyzes and describes the inherently inter-sentential nature of quantification and anaphora in a strictly lexicalized and compositional manner.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The present study shows that the proposed translation method successfully combines robustness and descriptive adequacy of contemporary semantics. The present implementation achieves high coverage, approximately 90%, for the real text of the Penn Treebank corpus.</Paragraph>
