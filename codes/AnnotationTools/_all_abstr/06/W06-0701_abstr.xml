Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A key task in an extraction system for query-oriented multi-document summarisation, necessary for computing relevance and redundancy, is modelling text semantics. In the Embra system, we use a representation derived from the singular value decomposition of a term co-occurrence matrix. We present methods to show the reliability of performance improvements.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We find that Embra performs better with dimensionality reduction.</Paragraph>
