Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> (PLSA) models have been shown to provide a better model for capturing polysemy and synonymy than Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). However, the parameters of a PLSA model are trained using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and as a result, the trained model is dependent on the initialization values so that performance can be highly variable.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Inthispaper wepresent amethodforusing LSA analysis to initialize a PLSA model.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We also investigated the performance of our method for the tasks of text segmentation and retrieval onpersonal-size corpora, and present results demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach.</Paragraph>
