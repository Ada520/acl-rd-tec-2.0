Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents the design of a discourse generator that plans the content and organization of lay-oriented genetic counseling documents containing arguments, and an experiment to evaluate the arguments. Due to the separation of domain, argument, and genre-specific concerns and the methodology used for acquiring a domain model, this approach should be applicable to argument generation in other domains.</Paragraph>
