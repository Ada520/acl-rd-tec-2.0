Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce the problem of explicit modeling of form relationships between words in different languages, focusing here on languages having an alphabetic writing system and affixal morphology.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present an algorithm that learns the cross-language correspondence between affixes and letter sequences. The algorithm does not assume prior knowledge of affixes in any of the languages, using only a simple single letter correspondence as seed. Results are given for the English-Spanish language pair.</Paragraph>
