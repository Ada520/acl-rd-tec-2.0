Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a task-level evaluation of the French to English version of MedSLT, a medium-vocabulary unidirectional controlled language medical speech translation system designed for doctor-patient diagnosis interviews. Our main goal was to establish task performance levels of novice users and compare them to expert users. Tests were carried out on eight medical students with no previous exposure to the system, with each student using the system for a total of three sessions. By the end of the third session, all the students were able to use the system confidently, with an average task completion time of about 4 minutes.</Paragraph>
