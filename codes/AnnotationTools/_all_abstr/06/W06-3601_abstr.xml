Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A syntax-directed translator first parses the source-language input into a parsetree, and then recursively converts the tree into a string in the target-language. We model this conversion by an extended tree-to-string transducer that have multi-level trees on the source-side, which gives our system more expressive power and flexibility. We also define a direct probability model and use a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm to search for the best derivation. The model is then extended to the general log-linear framework in order to rescore with other features like n-gram language models. We devise a simple-yet-effective algorithm to generate non-duplicate k-best translations for n-gram rescoring. Initial experimental results on English-to-Chinese translation are presented.</Paragraph>
