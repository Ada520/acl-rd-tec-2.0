Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We are trying to extend the boundary of Information Extraction (IE) systems. Existing IE systems require a lot of time and human effort to tune for a new scenario.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Preemptive Information Extraction is an attempt to automatically create all feasible IE systems in advance without human intervention. We propose a technique called Unrestricted Relation Discovery that discovers all possible relations from texts and presents them as tables. We present a preliminary system that obtains reasonably good results.</Paragraph>
