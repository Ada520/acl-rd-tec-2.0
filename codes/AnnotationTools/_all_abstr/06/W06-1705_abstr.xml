Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a proposal to facilitate the use of the annotated web as corpus by alleviating the annotation bottleneck for corpus data drawn from the web.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We describe a framework for large-scale distributed corpus annotation using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to meet this need. We also propose to annotate a large reference corpus in order to evaluate this framework. This will allow us to investigate the affordances offered by distributed techniques to ensure replicability of linguistic research based on web-derived corpora.</Paragraph>
