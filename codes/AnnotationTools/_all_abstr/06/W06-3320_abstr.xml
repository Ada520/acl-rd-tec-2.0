Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a pilot project in semi-automatically refactoring a biomedical corpus. The total time expended was just over three person-weeks, suggesting that this is a cost-efficient process. The refactored corpus is available for download at http://bionlp.sourceforge.net.</Paragraph>
