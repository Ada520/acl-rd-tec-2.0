Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Asian languages are far from most western-style in their non-separate word sequence especially Chinese. The preliminary step of Asian-like language processing is to find the word boundaries between words. In this paper, we present a general purpose model for both Chinese word segmentation and named entity recognition. This model was built on the word sequence classification with probability model, i.e., conditional random fields (CRF). We used a simple feature set for CRF which achieves satisfactory classification result on the two tasks. Our model achieved 91.00 in F rate in UPUC-Treebank data, and 78.71 for NER task.</Paragraph>
