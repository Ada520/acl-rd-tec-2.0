Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> There are some sorts of 'Preposition + Noun' combinations in Farsi that apparently a Prepositional Phrase almost behaves as Compound Prepositions. As they are not completely behaving as compounds, it is doubtful that the process of word formation is a morphological one.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The analysis put forward by this paper proposes &amp;quot;incorporation&amp;quot; by which an N o is incorporated to a P o constructing a compound preposition. In this way tagging prepositions and parsing texts in Natural Language Processing is defined in a proper manner.</Paragraph>
