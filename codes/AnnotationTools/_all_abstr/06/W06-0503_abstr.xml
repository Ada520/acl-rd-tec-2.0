Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> One of the challenging tasks in the context of the Semantic Web is to automatically extract instances of binary relations from Web documents - for example all pairs of a person and the corresponding birthdate. In this paper, we present LEILA, a system that can extract instances of arbitrary given binary relations from natural language Web documents - without human interaction. Different from previous approaches, LEILA uses a deep syntactic analysis. This results in consistent improvements over comparable systems (such as e.g. Snowball or TextToOnto).</Paragraph>
