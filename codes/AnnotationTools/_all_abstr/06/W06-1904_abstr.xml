<Paragraph position="0"> This article presents a bilingual question answering system, which is able to process questions and documents both in French and in English. Two cross-lingual strategies are described and evaluated. First, we study the contribution of biterms translation, and the influence of the completion of the translation dictionaries. Then, we propose a strategy for transferring the question analysis from one language to the other, and we study its influence on the performance of our system.</Paragraph>
