Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Surface realisation from flat semantic formulae is known to be exponential in the length of the input. In this paper, we argue that TAG naturally supports the integration of three main ways of reducing complexity: polarity filtering, delayed adjunction and empty semantic items elimination. We support these claims by presenting some preliminary results of the TAG-based surface realiser GenI.</Paragraph>
