</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a method for identifying token instances of verb particle constructions (VPCs) automatically, based on the output of the RASP parser. The proposed method pools together instances of VPCs and verb-PPs from the parser output and uses the sentential context of each such instance to differentiate VPCs from verb-PPs. We show our technique to perform at an F-score of 97.4% at identifying VPCs in Wall Street Journal and Brown Corpus data taken from the Penn Treebank. null</Paragraph>
