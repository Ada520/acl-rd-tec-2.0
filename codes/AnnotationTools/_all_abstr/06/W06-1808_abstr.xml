Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present an approach which aims at providing numerical answers in a question-answering system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> These answers are generated in a cooperative way: they explain the variation of numerical values when several values, apparently incoherent, are extracted from the web as possible answers to a question.</Paragraph>
