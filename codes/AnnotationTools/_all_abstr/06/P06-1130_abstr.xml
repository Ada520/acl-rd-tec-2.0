Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a novel PCFG-based architecture for robust probabilistic generation based on wide-coverage LFG approximations (Cahill et al., 2004) automatically extracted from treebanks, maximising the probability of a tree given an f-structure.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We evaluate our approach using string-based evaluation. We currently achieve coverage of 95.26%, a BLEU score of 0.7227 and string accuracy of 0.7476 on the Penn-II WSJ Section 23 sentences of length [?]20.</Paragraph>
