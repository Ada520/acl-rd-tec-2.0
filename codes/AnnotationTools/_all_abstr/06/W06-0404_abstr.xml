Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The literature investigating the notion of presupposition in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) has mainly been dubbed as being semantic (Simons 2003).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper investigates the linguistic application of pragmatic-based constraints to the 'semantic' notion of presupposition in DRT. By applying pragmatic-based constraints to presuppositional phenomenon, we aim to defend DRT against the accusation that DRT's interpretation of presuppositional phenomenon is essentially 'semantic' and push this interpretation further towards the pragmatic side of the semantic/pragmatic interface.1</Paragraph>
