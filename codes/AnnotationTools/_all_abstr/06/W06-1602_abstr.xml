Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we introduce an empirical approach to the semantic interpretation of superlative adjectives. We present a corpus annotated for superlatives and propose an interpretation algorithm that uses a wide-coverage parser and produces semantic representations. We achieve F-scores between 0.84 and 0.91 for detecting attributive superlatives and an accuracy in the range of 0.69-0.84 for determining the correct comparison set. As far as we are aware, this is the first automated approach to superlatives for open-domain texts and questions.</Paragraph>
