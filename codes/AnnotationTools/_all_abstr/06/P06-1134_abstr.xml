Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Subjectivity and meaning are both important properties of language. This paper explores their interaction, and brings empirical evidence in support of the hypotheses that (1) subjectivity is a property that can be associated with word senses, and (2) word sense disambiguation can directly benefit from subjectivity annotations.</Paragraph>
