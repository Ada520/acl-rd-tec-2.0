Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the largest scale annotation project involving the Enron email corpus to date. Over 12,500 emails were classified, by humans, into the categories &amp;quot;Business&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Personal&amp;quot;, and then subcategorised by type within these categories. The paper quantifies how well humans perform on this task (evaluated by inter-annotator agreement). It presents the problems experienced with the separation of these language types. As a final section, the paper presents preliminary results using a machine to perform this classification task.</Paragraph>
