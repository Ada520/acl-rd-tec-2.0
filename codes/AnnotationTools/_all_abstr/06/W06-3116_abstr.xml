Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present here the translation system we used in this year's WMT shared task. The main objective of our participation was to test RAMSES, an open source phrase-based decoder. For that purpose, we used the baseline system made available by the organizers of the shared task1 to build the necessary models. We then carried out a pair-to-pair comparison of RAMSES with PHARAOH on the six different translation directions that we were asked to perform.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present this comparison in this paper.</Paragraph>
