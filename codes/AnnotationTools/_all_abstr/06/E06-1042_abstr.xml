Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present TroFi (Trope Finder), a system for automatically classifying literal and nonliteral usages of verbs through nearly unsupervised word-sense disambiguation and clustering techniques.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> TroFi uses sentential context instead of selectional constraint violations or paths in semantic hierarchies. It also uses literal and nonliteral seed sets acquired and cleaned without human supervision in order to bootstrap learning. We adapt a word-sense disambiguation algorithm to our task and augment it with multiple seed set learners, a voting schema, and additional features like SuperTags and extra-sentential context. Detailed experiments on hand-annotated data show that our enhanced algorithm outperforms the base-line by 24.4%. Using the TroFi algorithm, we also build the TroFi Example Base, an extensible resource of annotated literal/nonliteral examples which is freely available to the NLP research community.</Paragraph>
