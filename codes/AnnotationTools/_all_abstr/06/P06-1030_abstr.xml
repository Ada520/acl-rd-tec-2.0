Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We have developed an automated Japanese essay scoring system called Jess. The system needs expert writings rather than expert raters to build the evaluation model.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> By detecting statistical outliers of predetermined aimed essay features compared with many professional writings for each prompt, our system can evaluate essays.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The following three features are examined: (1) rhetoric -- syntactic variety, or the use of various structures in the arrangement of phases, clauses, and sentences, (2) organization -- characteristics associated with the orderly presentation of ideas, such as rhetorical features and linguistic cues, and (3) content -- vocabulary related to the topic, such as relevant information and precise or specialized vocabulary. The final evaluation score is calculated by deducting from a perfect score assigned by a learning process using editorials and columns from the Mainichi Daily News newspaper. A diagnosis for the essay is also given.</Paragraph>
