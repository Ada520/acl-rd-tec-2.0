Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The Japanese language has various types of compound functional expressions, which are very important for recognizing the syntactic structures of Japanese sentences and for understanding their semantic contents. In this paper, we formalize the task of identifying Japanese compound functional expressions in a text as a chunking problem. We apply a machine learning technique to this task, where we employ that of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing Japanese text processing tools.</Paragraph>
