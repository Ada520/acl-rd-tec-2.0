</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We demonstrate a proof-of-concept system that uses a shallow chunking-based technique for knowledge extraction from natural language text, in particular looking at the task of story understanding. This technique is extended with a reasoning engine that borrows techniques from dynamic ontology refinement to discover the semantic similarity of stories and to merge them together.</Paragraph>
