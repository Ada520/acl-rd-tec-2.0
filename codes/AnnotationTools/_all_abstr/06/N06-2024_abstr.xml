</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a method based on &amp;quot;tweaking&amp;quot; an existing learned sequential classifier to change the recall-precision tradeoff, guided by a user-provided performance criterion. This method is evaluated on the task of recognizing personal names in email and newswire text, and proves to be both simple and effective.</Paragraph>
