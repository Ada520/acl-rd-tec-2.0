Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Aligning sentences belonging to comparable monolingual corpora has been suggested as a first step towards training text rewriting algorithms, for tasks such as summarization or paraphrasing. We present here a new monolingual sentence alignment algorithm, combining a sentence-based TF*IDF score, turned into a probability distribution using logistic regression, with a global alignment dynamic programming algorithm. Our approach provides a simpler and more robust solution achieving a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing systems.</Paragraph>
