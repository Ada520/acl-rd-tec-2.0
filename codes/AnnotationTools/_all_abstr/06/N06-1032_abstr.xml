Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach to statistical machine translation that combines ideas from phrase-based SMT and traditional grammar-based MT. Our system incorporates the concept of multi-word translation units into transfer of dependency structure snippets, and models and trains statistical components according to state-of-the-art SMT systems. Compliant with classical transfer-based MT, target dependency structure snippets are input to a grammar-based generator. An experimental evaluation shows that the incorporation of a grammar-based generator into an SMT framework provides improved grammaticality while achieving state-of-the-art quality on in-coverage examples, suggesting a possible hybrid framework.</Paragraph>
