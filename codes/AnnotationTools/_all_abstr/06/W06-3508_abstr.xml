Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes our ongoing work in and thoughts on developing a grammar learning system based on a construction grammar formalism. Necessary modules are presented and first results and challenges in formalizing the grammar are shown up. Furthermore, we point out the major reasons why we chose construction grammar as the most fitting formalism for our purposes. Then our approach and ideas of learning new linguistic phenomena, ranging from holophrastic constructions to compositional ones, is presented.</Paragraph>
