Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An algorithm based on the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm is described that allows thesingular valuedecomposition of a dataset to be learned based on single observation pairs presented serially. The algorithm has minimal memory requirements, and is therefore interesting in the natural language domain, where very large datasets are often used, and datasets quickly become intractable. The technique is demonstrated on the task of learning word and letter bigram pairs from text.</Paragraph>
