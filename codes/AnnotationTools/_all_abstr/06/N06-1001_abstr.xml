Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a probabilistic bilingual capitalization model for capitalizing machine translation outputs using conditional random fields. Experiments carried out on three language pairs and a variety of experiment conditions show that our model significantly outperforms a strong mono-lingual capitalization model baseline, especially when working with small datasets and/or European language pairs.</Paragraph>
