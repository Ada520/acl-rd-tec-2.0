Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Dialog systems for mobile robots operating in the real world should enable mixed-initiative dialog style, handle multi-modal information involved in the communication and be relatively independent of the domain knowledge. Most dialog systems developed for mobile robots today, however, are often system-oriented and have limited capabilities. We present an agent-based dialog model that are specially designed for human-robot interaction and provide evidence for its efficiency with our implemented system.</Paragraph>
