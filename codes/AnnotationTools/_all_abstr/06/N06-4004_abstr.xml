Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The MTTK alignment toolkit for statistical machine translation can be used for word, phrase, and sentence alignment of parallel documents. It is designed mainly for building statistical machine translation systems, but can be exploited in other multi-lingual applications. It provides computationally efficient alignment and estimation procedures that can be used for the unsupervised alignment of parallel text collections in a language independent fashion. MTTK Version 1.0 is available under the Open Source Educational Community License.</Paragraph>
