Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> MedSLT is a unidirectional medical speech translation system intended for use in doctor-patient diagnosis dialogues, which provides coverage of several different language pairs and subdomains. Vocabulary ranges from about 350 to 1000 surface words, depending on the language and subdomain. We will demo both the system itself and the development environment, which uses a combination of rule-based and data-driven methods to construct efficient recognisers, generators and transfer rule sets from small corpora.</Paragraph>
