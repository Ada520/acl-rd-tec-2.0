Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The Arabic language has far richer systems of inflection and derivation than English which has very little morphology.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This morphology difference causes a large gap between the vocabulary sizes in any given parallel training corpus. Segmentation of inflected Arabic words is a way to smooth its highly morphological nature. In this paper, we describe some statistically and linguistically motivated methods for Arabic word segmentation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Then, we show the efficiency of proposed methods on the Arabic-English BTEC and NIST tasks.</Paragraph>
