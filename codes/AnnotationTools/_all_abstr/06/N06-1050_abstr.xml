Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach to building a test collection of research papers. The approach is based on the Cran eld 2 tests but uses as its vehicle a current conference; research questions and relevance judgements of all cited papers are elicited from conference authors. The resultant test collection is different from TREC's in that it comprises scienti c articles rather than newspaper text and, thus, allows for IR experiments that include citation information. The test collection currently consists of 170 queries with relevance judgements; the document collection is the ACL Anthology. We describe properties of our queries and relevance judgements, and demonstrate the use of the test collection in an experimental setup. One potentially problematic property of our collection is that queries have a low number of relevant documents; we discuss ways of alleviating this.</Paragraph>
