Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Georgian is a less commonly studied language with complex, non-concatenative verbal morphology. We present a computational model for generation and recognition of Georgian verb conjugations, relying on the analysis of Georgian verb structure as a word-level template. The model combines a set of finite-state transducers with a default inheritance mechanism.1</Paragraph>
