Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Recent literature on text-tagging reported successful results by applying Maximum Entropy (ME) models. In general, ME taggers rely on carefully selected binary features, which try to capture discriminant information from the training data. This paper introduces a standard setting of binary features, inspired by the literature on named-entity recognition and text chunking, and derives corresponding real-valued features based on smoothed logprobabilities. The resulting ME models have orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Effective use of training data to estimate features and parameters is achieved by integrating a leaving-one-out method into the standard ME training algorithm.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Experimental results on two tagging tasks show statistically significant performance gains after augmenting standard binaryfeature models with real-valued features.</Paragraph>
