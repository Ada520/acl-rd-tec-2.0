Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a novel approach for the automatic generation and evaluation of a trivial dialogue phrases database. A trivial dialogue phrase is de ned as an expression used by a chatbot program as the answer of a user input. A transfer-like genetic algorithm (GA) method is used to generating the trivial dialogue phrases for the creation of a natural language generation (NLG) knowledge base. The automatic evaluation of a generated phrase is performed by producing n-grams and retrieving their frequencies from the World Wide Web (WWW). Preliminary experiments show very positive results.</Paragraph>
