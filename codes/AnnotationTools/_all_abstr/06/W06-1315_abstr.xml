</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A problem in dialogue research is that of finding and managing expectations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Adjacency pair theory has widespread acceptance, but traditional classification features (in particular, 'previous-tag' type features) do not exploit this information optimally. We suggest a method of dialogue segmentation that verifies adjacency pairs and allows us to use dialogue-level information within the entire segment and not just the previous utterance. We also use the kh  test for statistical significance as 'noise reduction' to refine a list of pairs. Together, these methods can be used to extend expectation beyond the traditional classification features.</Paragraph>
