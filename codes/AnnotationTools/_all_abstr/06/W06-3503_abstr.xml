Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe the WHY2-ATLAS intelligent tutoring system for qualitative physics that interacts with students via natural language dialogue. We focus on the issue of analyzing and responding to multi-sentential explanations. We explore an approach that combines a statistical classifier, multiple semantic parsers and a formal reasoner for achieving a deeper understanding of these explanations in order to provide appropriate feedback on them.</Paragraph>
