Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This study investigates the support of multiple information seeking strategies (ISSs) within a single system, and the relation between varieties of ISSs and system design. It proposes to construct and evaluate an interactive information retrieval system which can adaptively support multiple ISSs, and allow change from one ISS to another within an ISS space. It is conducted in a series of steps: iterative designing -evaluating of several systems supporting different ISSs; specifying an interaction structure for multiple ISSs; and, implementing and evaluating a dynamically adaptive system supporting multiple ISSs. The study aims to make a contribution to interactive information retrieval drawing attention to user interface design, and to HCI, in integration of multiple support techniques within a single system framework.</Paragraph>
