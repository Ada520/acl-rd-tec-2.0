</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we introduce a methodology for analyzing judgment opinions. We define a judgment opinion as consisting of a valence, a holder, and a topic. We decompose the task of opinion analysis into four parts: 1) recognizing the opinion; 2) identifying the valence; 3) identifying the holder; and 4) identifying the topic. In this paper, we address the first three parts and evaluate our methodology using both intrinsic and extrinsic measures.</Paragraph>
