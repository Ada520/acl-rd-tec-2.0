</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a framework for multi-lingual dependency parsing. Our bottom-up deterministic parser adopts Nivre's algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a preprocessor. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are utilized to determine the word dependency attachments. Then, a maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) is used for determining the label of the dependency relation. To improve the performance of the parser, we construct a tagger based on SVMs to find neighboring attachment as a preprocessor. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed extension improves the parsing accuracy of our base parser in 9 languages.
