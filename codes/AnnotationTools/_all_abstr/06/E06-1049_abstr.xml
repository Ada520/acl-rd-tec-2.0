Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Carsim is a program that automatically converts narratives into 3D scenes. Carsim considers authentic texts describing road accidents, generally collected from web sitesofSwedishnewspapers ortranscribed from hand-written accounts by victims of accidents. One of the program's key featuresisthatitanimatesthegenerated scene to visualize events.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> To create a consistent animation, Carsim extracts the participants mentioned in a text and identifies what they do. In this paper, we focus on the extraction of temporal relations between actions. We first describe how we detect time expressions and events. We then present a machine learning technique to order the sequence of events identified in the narratives. We finally report the results we obtained.</Paragraph>
