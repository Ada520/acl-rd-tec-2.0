Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a detailed study of the integration of knowledge from both dependency parses and hierarchical word ontologies into a maximum-entropy-based tagging model that simultaneously labels words with both syntax and semantics.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our findings show that information from both these sources can lead to strong improvements in overall system accuracy: dependency knowledge improved performanceoverallclassesofword,andknowl- null edge of the position of a word in an ontological hierarchy increased accuracy for words not seen in the training data. The resulting tagger offers the highest reported tagging accuracy on this tagset to date.</Paragraph>
