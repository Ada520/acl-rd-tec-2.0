Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In many information retrieval and selection tasks it is valuable to score how much a text is about a certain entity and to compute how much the text discusses the entity with respect to a certain viewpoint. In this paper we are interested in giving an aboutness score to a text, when the input query is a person name and we want to measure the aboutness with respect to the biographical data of that person. We present a graph-based algorithm and compare its results with other approaches.</Paragraph>
