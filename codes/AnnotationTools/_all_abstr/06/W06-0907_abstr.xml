Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Current research in developmental biology aims to link developmental genetic pathways with the processes going on at cellular and tissue level. Normal processes will only take place under speci c sequential conditions at the level of the pathways. Disrupting or altering pathways may mean disrupted or altered development.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper is part of a larger work exploring methods of detecting and extracting information on developmental events from free text and on their relations in space and time.</Paragraph>
