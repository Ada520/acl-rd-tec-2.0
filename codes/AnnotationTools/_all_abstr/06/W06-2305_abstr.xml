<Paragraph position="0"> Covering as many phenomena as possible is a traditional goal of parser development, but the broader a grammar is made, the blunter it may become,asrare constructionsinfluencethe behaviour on simple sentences that were already solved correctly. We observe the effects of intentionally removing support for specific constructions from a broad-coverage grammar of German. We show that accuracy of analysing sentences from the NEGRA corpus can be improved not only for sentences that do not need the extra coverage, but even when including those that do.</Paragraph>
