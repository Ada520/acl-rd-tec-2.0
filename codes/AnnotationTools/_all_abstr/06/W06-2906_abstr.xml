Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We demonstrate an original and successful approach for both resolving and generating definite anaphora. We propose and evaluate unsupervised models for extracting hypernym relations by mining co-occurrence data of definite NPs and potential antecedents in an unlabeled corpus. The algorithm outperforms a standard WordNet-based approach to resolving and generating definite anaphora. It also substantially outperforms recent related work using pattern-based extraction of such hypernym relations for coreference resolution.</Paragraph>
