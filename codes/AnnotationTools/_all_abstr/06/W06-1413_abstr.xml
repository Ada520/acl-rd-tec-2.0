Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Existing algorithms for the Generation of Referring Expressions (GRE) aim at generating descriptions that allow a hearer to identify its intended referent uniquely; the lengthoftheexpressionisalsoconsidered, usually as a secondary issue. We explore the possibility of making the trade-off between these two factors more explicit, via a general cost function which scores these two aspects separately. We sketch some more complex phenomena which might be amenable to this treatment.</Paragraph>
