Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a method for compiling bi-lingual terminologies of multi-word terms (MWTs) for given translation pairs of seed terms. Traditional methods for bi-lingual terminology compilation exploit parallel texts, while the more recent ones have focused on comparable corpora. We use bilingual corpora collected from the web and tailor made for the seed terms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> For each language, we extract from the corpus a set of MWTs pertaining to the seed's semantic domain, and use a compositional method to align MWTs from both sets. We increase the coverage of our system by using thesauri and by applying a bootstrap method. Experimental results show high precision and indicate promising prospects for future developments. null</Paragraph>
