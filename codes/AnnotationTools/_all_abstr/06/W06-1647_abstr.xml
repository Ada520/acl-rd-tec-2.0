Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We investigate the problem of learning a part-of-speech (POS) lexicon for a resource-poor language, dialectal Arabic.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Developing a high-quality lexicon is often the rst step towards building a POS tagger, which is in turn the front-end to many NLP systems. We frame the lexicon acquisition problem as a transductive learning problem, and perform comparisons on three transductive algorithms: Transductive SVMs, Spectral Graph Transducers, and a novel Transductive Clustering method. We demonstrate that lexicon learning is an important task in resource-poor domains and leads to signi cant improvements in tagging accuracy for dialectal Arabic.</Paragraph>
