</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a new approach based on Equivalent Pseudowords (EPs) to tackle Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in Chinese language. EPs are particular artificial ambiguous words, which can be used to realize unsupervised WSD.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A Bayesian classifier is implemented to test the efficacy of the EP solution on Senseval-3 Chinese test set. The performance is better than state-of-the-art results with an average F-measure of 0.80.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The experiment verifies the value of EP for unsupervised WSD.</Paragraph>
