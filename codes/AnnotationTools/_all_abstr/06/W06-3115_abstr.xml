Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present two translation systems experimented for the shared-task of &amp;quot;Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation,&amp;quot; a phrase-based model and a hierarchical phrase-based model. The former uses a phrasal unit for translation, whereas the latter is conceptualized as a synchronous-CFG in which phrases are hierarchically combined using non-terminals. Experiments showed that the hierarchical phrase-based model performed very comparable to the phrase-based model. We also report a phrase/rule extraction technique differentiating tokenization of corpora.</Paragraph>
