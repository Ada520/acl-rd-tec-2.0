Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a formalization of grammatical role labeling within the frameworkofInteger Linear Programming (ILP). We focus on the integration of sub-categorization information into the decision making process. We present a first empirical evaluation that achieves competitive precision and recall rates.</Paragraph>
