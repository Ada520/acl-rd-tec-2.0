Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Partial cognates are pairs of words in two languages that have the same meaning in some, but not all contexts. Detecting the actual meaning of a partial cognate in context can be useful for Machine Translation tools and for Computer-Assisted Language Learning tools. In this paper we propose a supervised and a semi-supervised method to disambiguate partial cognates between two languages: French and English. The methods use only automatically-labeled data; therefore they can be applied for other pairs of languages as well. We also show that our methods perform well when using corpora from different domains.</Paragraph>
