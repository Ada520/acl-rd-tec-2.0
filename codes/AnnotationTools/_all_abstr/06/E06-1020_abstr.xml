Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a word alignment platform which ensures text pre-processing (tokenization, POS-tagging, lemmatization, chunking, sentence alignment) as required by an accurate word alignment.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The platform combines two different methods, producing distinct alignments.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The basic word aligners are described in some details and are individually evaluated. The union of the individual alignments is subject to a filtering post-processing phase. Two different filtering methods are also presented. The evaluation shows that the combined word alignment contains 10.75% less errors than the best individual aligner.</Paragraph>
