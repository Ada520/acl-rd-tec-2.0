Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a study in which a corpus of spoken Danish annotated with focus and topic tags was used to investigate the relation between information structure and pauses. The results show that intra-clausal pauses in the focus domain, tend to precede those words that express the property or semantic type whereby the object in focus is distinguished from other ones in the domain.</Paragraph>
