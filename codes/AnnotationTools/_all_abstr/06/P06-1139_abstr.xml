Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose WIDL-expressions as a flexible formalism that facilitates the integration of a generic sentence realization system within end-to-end language processing applications. WIDL-expressions represent compactly probability distributions over finite sets of candidate realizations, and have optimal algorithms for realization via interpolation with language model probability distributions. We show the effectiveness of a WIDL-based NLG system in two sentence realization tasks: automatic translation and headline generation.</Paragraph>
