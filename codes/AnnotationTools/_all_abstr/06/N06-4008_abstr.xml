Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Ndaona is a Matlab toolkit to create interactive three-dimensional models of data often found in NLP research, such as exploring the results of classification and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Such models are useful for teaching, presentations and exploratory research (such as showing where a classification algorithm makes mistakes).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Ndaona includes embedding and graphics parameter estimation algorithms, and generates files in the format of Partiview (Levy, 2001), an existing free open-source fast multidimensional data displayer that has traditionally been used in the planetarium community. Partiview1 supports a number of enhancements to regular scatterplots that allow it to display more than three dimensions' worth of information.</Paragraph>
