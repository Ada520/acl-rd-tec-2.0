Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Unlexicalized probabilistic context-free parsing is a general and flexible approach that sometimes reaches competitive results in multilingual dependency parsing even if a minimum of language-specific information is supplied. Furthermore, integrating parser results (good at long dependencies) and tagger results (good at short range dependencies, and more easily adaptable to treebank peculiarities) gives competitive results in all languages.</Paragraph>
