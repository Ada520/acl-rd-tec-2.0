Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Morphologically complex terms composed from Greek or Latin elements are frequent in scientific and technical texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Word forming units are thus relevant cues for the identification of terms in domain-specific texts. This article describes a method for the automatic extraction of terms relying on the detection of classical prefixes and word-initial combining forms. Word-forming units are identified using a regular expression. The system then extracts terms by selecting words which either begin or coalesce with these elements. Next, terms are grouped in families which are displayed as a weighted list in HTML format.</Paragraph>
