Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we argue that in it-clefts as in It was Ohno who won, the cleft pronoun (it) and the cleft clause (who won) form a discontinuous syntactic constituent, and a semantic unit as a definite description, presenting arguments from Percus (1997) and Hedberg (2000). We propose a syntax of it-clefts using Tree-Local Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammar and a compositional semantics on the proposed syntax using Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar.</Paragraph>
