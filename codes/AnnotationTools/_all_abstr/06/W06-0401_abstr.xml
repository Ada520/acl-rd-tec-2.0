Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> One of the central assumptions of Optimality Theory is the hypothesis of strict domination among constraints. A few studies have suggested that this hypothesis is too strong and should be abandoned in favor of a weaker cumulativity hypothesis. If this suggestion is correct, we should be able to find evidence for cumulativity in the comprehension of Gapping sentences, which lack explicit syntactic clues in the form of the presence of a finite verb. On the basis of a comparison between several computational models of constraint evaluation, we conclude that the comprehension of Gapping sentences does not yield compelling evidence against the strict domination hypothesis.</Paragraph>
