Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we describe a coreference resolution method that employs a classification and a clusterization phase. In a novel way, the clusterization is produced as a graph cutting algorithm, in which nodes of the graph correspond to the mentions of the text, whereas the edges of the graph constitute the confidences derived from the coreference classification. In experiments, the graph cutting algorithm for coreference resolution, called BESTCUT, achieves state-of-the-art performance.</Paragraph>
