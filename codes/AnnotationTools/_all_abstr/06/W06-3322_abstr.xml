1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> There has been much interest in recent years on the topic of extracting Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) information automatically from scientific publications. This is due to the need that has emerged to organise the large body of literature that is generated through research, and collected at sites such as PubMed. Easy access to the information contained in published work is vital for facilitating new research, but the rate of publication makes manual collection of all such data unfeasible. Information Extraction approaches based on Natural Language Processing can be, and are already being used, to facilitate this process.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The dominant approach so far has been the use of hand-built, knowledge-based systems, working at levels ranging from surface syntax to full parses (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Huang et al., 2004; Plake et al., 2005; Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2005; Yakushiji et al., 2005). A similar work to the one presented here is by (Sugiyama et al., 2003), but it is not possible to compare results due to differing datasets and the limited information available about their methods.</Paragraph>
