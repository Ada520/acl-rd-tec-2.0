Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this article, we present a translation system which builds translations by gluing together Tree-Phrases, i.e. associations between simple syntactic dependency treelets in a source language and their corresponding phrases in a target language. The Tree-Phrases we use in this study are syntactically informed and present the advantage of gathering source and target material whose words do not have to be adjacent. We show that the phrase-based translation engine we implemented benefits from Tree-Phrases.</Paragraph>
