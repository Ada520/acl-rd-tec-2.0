</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we explain a rapid development method of multimodal dialogue sys-tem using MIML (Multimodal Interaction Markup Language), which defines dialogue patterns between human and various types of interactive agents. The feature of this language is three-layered description of agent-based interactive systems which separates task level description, interaction description and device dependent realization. MIML has advantages in high-level interaction description, modality extensibility and compatibility with standardized technologies. null</Paragraph>
