Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a deterministic parsing algorithm for projective dependency grammar. In a bottom-up way the algorithm finds the local optimum dynamically. A constraint procedure is made to use more structure information. The algorithm parses sentences in linear time and labeling is integrated with the parsing.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This parser achieves 63.29% labeled attachment score on the average in CoNLL-</Paragraph>
