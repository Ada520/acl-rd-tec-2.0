Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Countability of English nouns is important in various natural language processing tasks. It especially plays an important role in machine translation since it determines the range of possible determiners.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper proposes a method for reinforcing countability prediction by introducing a novel concept called one countability per discourse. It claims that when a noun appears more than once in a discourse, they will all share the same countability in the discourse. The basic idea of the proposed method is that mispredictions can be correctly overridden using ef ciently the one countability per discourse property. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully reinforces countability prediction and outperforms other methods used for comparison.</Paragraph>
