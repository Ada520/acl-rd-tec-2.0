Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an algorithm which creates a German CCGbank by translating the syntax graphs in the German Tiger corpus into CCG derivation trees. The resulting corpus contains 46,628 derivations, covering 95% of all complete sentences in Tiger.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Lexicons extracted from this corpus contain correct lexical entries for 94% of all known tokens in unseen text.</Paragraph>
