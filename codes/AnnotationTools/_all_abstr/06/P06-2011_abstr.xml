Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Named entity translation is indispensable in cross language information retrieval nowadays. We propose an approach of combining lexical information, web statistics, and inverse search based on Google to backward translate a Chinese named entity (NE) into English. Our system achieves a high Top-1 accuracy of 87.6%, which is a relatively good performance reported in this area until present. null</Paragraph>
