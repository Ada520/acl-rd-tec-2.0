Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting knowledge from unstructured text. We present a novel unsupervised approach for information extraction based on graph mutual reinforcement.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The proposed approach does not require any seed patterns or examples. Instead, it depends on redundancy in large data sets and graph based mutual reinforcement to induce generalized &amp;quot;extraction patterns&amp;quot;. The proposed approach has been used to acquire extraction patterns for the ACE</Paragraph>
