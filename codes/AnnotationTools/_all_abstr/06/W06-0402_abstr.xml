Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We provide two different methods for bounding search when parsing with freer word-order languages. Both of these can be thought of as exploiting alternative sources of constraints not commonly used in CFGs, in order to make up for the lack of more rigid word-order and the standard algorithms that use the assumption of rigid word-order implicitly. This work is preliminary in that it has not yet been evaluated on a large-scale grammar/corpus for a freer word-order language.</Paragraph>
