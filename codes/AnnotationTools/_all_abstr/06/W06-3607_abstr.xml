<Paragraph position="0"> Integrating information from different stages of an NLP processing pipeline can yield significant error reduction. We demonstrate how re-ranking can improve name tagging in a Chinese information extraction system by incorporating information from relation extraction, event extraction, and coreference. We evaluate three state-of-the-art re-ranking algorithms (MaxEnt-Rank, SVMRank, and p-Norm Push Ranking), and show the benefit of multi-stage re-ranking for cross-sentence and cross-document inference.</Paragraph>
