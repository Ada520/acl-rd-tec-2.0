Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose to organise a series of shared-task NLG events, where participants are asked to build systems with similar input/output functionalities, and these systems are evaluated with a range of different evaluation techniques. The main purpose of these events is to allow us to compare different evaluation techniques, by correlating the results of different evaluations on the systems entered in the events.</Paragraph>
