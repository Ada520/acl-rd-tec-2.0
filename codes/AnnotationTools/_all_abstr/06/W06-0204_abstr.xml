Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a novel approach to the semi-supervised learning of Information Extraction patterns. The method makes use of more complex patterns than previous approaches and determines their similarity using a measure inspired by recent work using kernel methods (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004). Experiments show that the proposed similarity measure out-performs a previously reported measure based on cosine similarity when used to perform binary relation extraction.</Paragraph>
