Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a word support model (WSM). The WSM can effectively perform homophone selection and syllable-word segmentation to improve Chinese input systems. The experimental results show that: (1) the WSM is able to achieve tonal (syllables input with four tones) and toneless (syllables input without four tones) syllable-to-word (STW) accuracies of 99% and 92%, respectively, among the converted words; and (2) while applying the WSM as an adaptation processing, together with the Microsoft Input Method Editor 2003 (MSIME) and an optimized bigram model, the average tonal and toneless STW improvements are 37% and 35%, respectively. null</Paragraph>
