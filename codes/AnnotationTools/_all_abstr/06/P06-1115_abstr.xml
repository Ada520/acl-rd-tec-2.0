<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new approach for mapping natural language sentences to their formal meaning representations using stringkernel-basedclassifiers. Oursystemlearns theseclassifiersforeveryproductioninthe formallanguagegrammar. Meaningrepresentations for novel natural language sentences are obtained by finding the most probable semantic parse using these string classifiers. Our experiments on two real-world data sets show that this approach compares favorably to other existing systems and is particularly robust to noise.</Paragraph>
