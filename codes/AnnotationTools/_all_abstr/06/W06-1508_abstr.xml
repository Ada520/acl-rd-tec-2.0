Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Several grammars have been proposed for modeling RNA pseudoknotted structure. In this paper, we focus on multiple context-free grammars (MCFGs), which are natural extension of context-free grammars and can represent pseudoknots, and extend a specific subclass of MCFGs to a probabilistic model called SMCFG. We present a polynomial time parsing algorithm for finding the most probable derivation tree and a probability parameter estimation algorithm. Furthermore, we show some experimental results of pseudoknot prediction using SMCFG algorithm.</Paragraph>
