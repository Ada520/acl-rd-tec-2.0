Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This demonstration provides a historical perspective of a number of research and commercial systems in Spoken Language Technology over the past 20+ years. A series of chronologically ordered video clips from many sources will be presented to illustrate the many steps and the tremendous progress that has been achieved over the years. The clips themselves are drawn from diverse academic and commercial research labs, product presentations, and user applications. All show systems being demonstrated or in actual use. Over 20 different laboratory systems, products, and companies are represented in this collection of video materials. Each of the clips has previously been shown publicly. The present selection primarily focuses on speech and natural language systems for speech recognition and synthesis. Additional contributions to this collection are welcome.  this project is to collect, preserve, and make readily available information about significant research discoveries, technical achievements, and business developments in speech and language technology. For further information on this project, please go to www.SarasInstitute.org.</Paragraph>
