Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The results of experiments on the application of a variety of distance measures to a question-answering task are reported.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Variants of tree-distance are considered, including whole-vs-sub tree, node weighting, wild cards and lexical emphasis. We derive string-distance as a special case of tree-distance and show that a particular parameterisation of tree-distance out-performs the string-distance measure.</Paragraph>
