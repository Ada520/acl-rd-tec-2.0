Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce a new type of lexical structure called lexical system , an interoperable model that can feed both monolingual and multilingual language resources. We begin with a formal characterization of lexical systems as &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; directed graphs, solely made up of nodes corresponding to lexical entities and links. To illustrate our approach, we present data borrowed from a lexical system that has been generated from the French DiCo database. We later explain how the compilation of the original dictionary-like database into a net-like one has been made possible. Finally, we discuss the potential of the proposed lexical structure for designing multilingual lexical resources.</Paragraph>
