Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we investigate how to automatically determine if two document collections are written from different perspectives. By perspectives we mean a point of view, for example, from the perspective of Democrats or Republicans. We propose a test of different perspectives based on distribution divergence between the statistical models of two collections.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Experimental results show that the test can successfully distinguish document collections of different perspectives from other types of collections.</Paragraph>
