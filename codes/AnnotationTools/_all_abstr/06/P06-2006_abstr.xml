Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We evaluate the accuracy of an unlexicalized statistical parser, trained on 4K treebanked sentences from balanced data and tested on the PARC DepBank. We  demonstratethataparserwhichiscompetitive in accuracy (without sacrificing processing speed) can be quickly tuned without reliance on large in-domain manually-constructed treebanks. This makes it more practical to use statistical parsers in applications that need access to aspects of predicate-argument structure. The comparison of systems using DepBank is not straightforward, so we extend and validate DepBank and highlight a number of representation and scoring issues for relational evaluation schemes.</Paragraph>
