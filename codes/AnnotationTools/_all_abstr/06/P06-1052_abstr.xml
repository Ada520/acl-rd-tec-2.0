Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an efficient algorithm for the redundancy elimination problem: Given an underspecified semantic representation (USR) of a scope ambiguity, compute an USR with fewer mutually equivalent readings. Thealgorithm operateson underspecified chart representations which are derived from dominance graphs; it can be applied to the USRs computed by large-scale grammars. We evaluate the algorithm on a corpus, and show that it reduces the degree of ambiguity significantly while taking negligible runtime.</Paragraph>
