Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports on an experiment in which we explore a new approach to the automatic measurement of multi-word expression (MWE) compositionality. We propose an algorithm which ranks MWEs by their compositionality relative to a semantic field taxonomy based on the Lancaster English semantic lexicon (Piao et al., 2005a). The semantic information provided by the lexicon is used for measuring the semantic distance between a MWE and its constituent words. The algorithm is evaluated both on 89 manually ranked MWEs and on McCarthy et al's (2003) manually ranked phrasal verbs.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We compared the output of our tool with human judgments using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient. Our evaluation shows that the automatic ranking of the majority of our test data (86.52%) has strong to moderate correlation with the manual ranking while wide discrepancy is found for a small number of MWEs. Our algorithm also obtained a correlation of 0.3544 with manual ranking on McCarthy et al's test data, which is comparable or better than most of the measures they tested. This experiment demonstrates that a semantic lexicon can assist in MWE compositionality measurement in addition to statistical algorithms. null</Paragraph>
