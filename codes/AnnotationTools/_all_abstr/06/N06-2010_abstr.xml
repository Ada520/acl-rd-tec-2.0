Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Coreference resolution, like many problems in natural language processing, has most often been explored using datasets of written text. While spontaneous spoken language poses well-known challenges, it also offers additional modalities that may help disambiguate some of the inherent disfluency. We explore features of hand gesture that are correlated with coreference. Combining these features with a traditional textual model yields a statistically significant improvement in overall performance. null</Paragraph>
