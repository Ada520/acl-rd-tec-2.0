Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper is concerned with the summarization of spontaneous conversations. Compared with broadcast news, which has received intensive study, spontaneous conversations have been less addressed in the literature. Previous work has focused on textual features extracted from transcripts. This paper explores and compares the effectiveness of both textual features and speech-related features. The experiments show that these features incrementally improve summarization performance. We also find that speech disfluencies, which have been removed as noise in previous work, help identify important utterances, while the structural feature is less effective than it is in broadcast news.</Paragraph>
