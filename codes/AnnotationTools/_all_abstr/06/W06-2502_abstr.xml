Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> As text data becomes plentiful, unsupervised methods for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) become more viable. A problem encountered in applying WSD methods is finding the exact number of senses an ambiguity has in a training corpus collected in an automated manner.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> That number is not known a priori; rather it needs to be determined based on the data itself. We address that problem using cluster stopping methods. Such techniques have not previously applied to WSD. We implement the methods of Calinski and Harabasz (1975) and Hartigan (1975) and our adaptation of the Gap statistic (Tibshirani, Walter and Hastie, 2001). For evaluation, we use the WSD Test Set from the National Library of Medicine, whose sense inventory is the Unified Medical Language System. The best accuracy for selecting the correct number of clusters is 0.60 with the C&amp;H method. Our error analysis shows that the cluster stopping methods make finer-grained sense distinctions by creating additional clusters. The highest F-scores (82.89), indicative of the quality of cluster membership assignment, are comparable to the baseline majority sense (82.63) and point to a path towards accuracy improvement via additional cluster pruning. The importance and significance of the current work is in applying cluster stopping rules to WSD.</Paragraph>
