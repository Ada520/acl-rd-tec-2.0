Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a statistical, tree-to-tree model for producing translations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Two main contributions are as follows: (1) a method for the extraction of syntactic structures with alignment information from a parallel corpus of translations, and (2) use of a discriminative, feature-based model for prediction of these target-language syntactic structures--which we call aligned extended projections, or AEPs. An evaluation of the method on translation from German to English shows similar performance to the phrase-based model of Koehn et al. (2003).</Paragraph>
