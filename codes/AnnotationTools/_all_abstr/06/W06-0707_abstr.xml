<Paragraph position="0"> (DUC) 2005 evaluation had a single useroriented, question-focused summarization task, which was to synthesize from a set of 25-50 documents a well-organized, fluent answer to a complex question. The evaluation shows that the best summarization systems have difficulty extracting relevant sentences in response to complex questions (as opposed to representative sentences that might be appropriate to a generic summary). The relatively generous allowance of 250 words for each answer also reveals how difficult it is for current summarization systems to produce fluent text from multiple documents.</Paragraph>
