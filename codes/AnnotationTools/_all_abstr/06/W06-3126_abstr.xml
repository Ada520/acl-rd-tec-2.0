Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe the LDV-COMBO system presented at the Shared Task. Our approach explores the possibility of working with alignments at different levels of abstraction using different degrees of linguistic analysis from the lexical to the shallow syntactic level. Translation models are built on top of combinations of these alignments. We present results for the Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish tasks. We show that liniguistic information may be helpful, specially when the target language has a rich morphology.</Paragraph>
