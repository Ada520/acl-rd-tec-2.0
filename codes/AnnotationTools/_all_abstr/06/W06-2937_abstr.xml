Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we propose a three-step multilingual dependency parser, which generalizes an efficient parsing algorithm at first phase, a root parser and post-processor at the second and third stages. The main focus of our work is to provide an efficient parser that is practical to use with combining only lexical and part-of-speech features toward language independent parsing. The experimental results show that our method outperforms Maltparser in 13 languages. We expect that such an efficient model is applicable for most languages.</Paragraph>
