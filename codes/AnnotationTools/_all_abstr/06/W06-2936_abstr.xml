Abstract

<Paragraph position="0"> Following (McDonald et al., 2005), we present an application of a maximum spanning tree algorithm for a directed graph to non-projective labeled dependency parsing. Using a variant of the voted perceptron (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004; Crammer and Singer, 2003), we discriminatively trained our parser in an on-line fashion. After just one epoch of training, we were generally able to attain average results in the CoNLL</Paragraph>
