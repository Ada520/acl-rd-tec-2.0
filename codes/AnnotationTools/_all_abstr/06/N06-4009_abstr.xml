Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We will demonstrate SconeEdit, a new tool for exploring and editing knowledge bases (KBs) that leverages interaction with domain texts. The tool provides an annotated view of user-selected text, allowing a user to see which concepts from the text are in the KB and to edit the KB directly from this Text View. Alongside the Text View, SconeEdit provides a navigable KB View of the knowledge base, centered on concepts that appear in the text. This unified tool gives the user a text-driven way to explore a KB and add new knowledge.</Paragraph>
