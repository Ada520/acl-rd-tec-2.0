Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this presentation, I will look back at 10 years of CoNLL conferences and the state oftheartofmachine learning oflanguage that is evident from this decade of research. My conclusion, intended to provoke discussion, will be that we currently lack a clear motivation or &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; to survive as a discipline. I will suggest that anewmission forthe fieldcould befound in a renewed interest for theoretical work (which learning algorithms have a bias that matches the properties of language?, what is the psycholinguistic relevance of learner design issues?), in more sophisticated comparative methodology, and in solving the problem of transfer, reusability,and adaptation oflearned knowledge.</Paragraph>
