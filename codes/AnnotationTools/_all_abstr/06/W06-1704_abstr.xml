</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents CUCWeb, a 166 million word corpus for Catalan built by crawling the Web. The corpus has been annotated with NLP tools and made available to language users through a flexible web interface. The developed architecture is quite general, so that it can be used to create corpora for other languages.</Paragraph>
