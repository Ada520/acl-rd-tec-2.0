Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a natural language query engine that enables users to search for entities, relationships, and events that are extracted from biological literature.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The query interpretation is guided by a domain ontology, which provides a mapping between linguistic structures and domain conceptual relations. We focus on the usability of the natural language interface to users who are used to keyword-based information retrieval. Preliminary evaluation of our approach using the GENIA corpus and ontology shows promising results.</Paragraph>
