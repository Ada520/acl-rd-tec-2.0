<Paragraph position="0"> The languages that are most commonly subject to linguistic annotation on a large scale tend to be those with the largest populations or with recent histories of linguistic scholarship. In this paper we discuss the problems associated with lower-density languages in the context of the development of linguistically annotated resources. We frame our work with three key questions regarding the definition of lower-density languages; increasing available resources and reducing data requirements. A number of steps forward are  identifiedforincreasingthenumberlowerdensity language corpora with linguistic annotations.</Paragraph>
