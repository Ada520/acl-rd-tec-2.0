</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Event detection and recognition is a complex task consisting of multiple sub-tasks of varying difficulty. In this paper, we present a simple, modular approach to event extraction that allows us to experiment with a variety of machine learning methods for these sub-tasks, as well as to evaluate the impact on performance these sub-tasks have on the overall task.</Paragraph>
