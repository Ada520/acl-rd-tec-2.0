Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The goal of my proposed dissertation work is to help answer two fundamental questions: (1) How is emotion communicated in speech? and (2) Does emotion modeling improve spoken dialogue applications? In this paper I describe feature extraction and emotion classi cation experiments I have conducted and plan to conduct on three different domains: EPSaT, HMIHY, and ITSpoke. In addition, I plan to implement emotion modeling capabilities into ITSpoke and evaluate the effectiveness of doing so.</Paragraph>
