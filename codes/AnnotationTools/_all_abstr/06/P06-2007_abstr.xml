Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We show that we can automatically classify semantically related phrases into 10 classes. Classification robustness is improved by training with multiple sources of evidence, including within-document cooccurrence, HTML markup, syntactic relationships in sentences, substitutability in query logs, and string similarity. Our work provides a benchmark for automatic n-way classification into WordNet's semantic classes, both on a TREC news corpus and on a corpus of substitutable search query phrases.</Paragraph>
