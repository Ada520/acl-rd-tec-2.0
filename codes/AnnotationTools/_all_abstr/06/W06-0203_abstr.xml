Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper deals with the use of computational linguistic analysis techniques for information access and ontology learning within the legal domain. We present a rule-based approach for extracting and analysing definitions from parsed text and evaluate it on a corpus of about 6000 German court decisions. The results are applied to improve the quality of a text based ontology learning method on this corpus.</Paragraph>
