Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present two novel paraphrase tests for automatically predicting the inherent semantic relation of a given compound nominalisation as one of subject, direct object, or prepositional object. We compare these to the usual verb argument paraphrase test using corpus statistics, and frequencies obtained by scraping the Google search engine interface. We also implemented a more robust statistical measure than maximum likelihood estimation the condence interval. A signi cant reduction in data sparseness was achieved, but this alone is insuf cient to provide a substantial performance improvement.</Paragraph>
