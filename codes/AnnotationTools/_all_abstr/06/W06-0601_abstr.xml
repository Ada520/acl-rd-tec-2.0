Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe an unusual data set of thousands of annotated images with interesting sense phenomena. Natural language image sense annotation involves increased semantic complexities compared to disambiguating word senses when annotating text. These issues are discussed and illustrated, including the distinction between word senses and iconographic senses.</Paragraph>
