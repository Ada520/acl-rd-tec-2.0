</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present results on the relation discovery task, which addresses some of the shortcomings of supervised relation extraction by applying minimally supervised methods. We describe a detailed experimental design that compares various configurations of conceptual representations and similarity measures across six different subsets of the ACE relation extraction data. Previous work on relation discovery used a semantic space based on a term-by-document matrix. We find that representations based on term co-occurrence perform significantly better. We also observe further improvements when reducing the dimensionality of the term co-occurrence matrix using probabilistic topic models, though these are not significant.</Paragraph>
