Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an implemented machine learning system for the automatic detection of nonreferential it in spoken dialog. The system builds on shallow features extracted from dialog transcripts. Our experiments indicate a level of performance that makes the system usable as a preprocessing filter for a coreference resolution system. We also report results of an annotationstudydealingwiththeclassificationof null it by naive subjects.</Paragraph>
