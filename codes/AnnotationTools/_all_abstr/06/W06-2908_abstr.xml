Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a method for recognizing semantic role arguments using a kernel on weighted marked ordered labeled trees (the WMOLT kernel). We extend the kernels on marked ordered labeled trees (Kazama and Torisawa, 2005) so that the mark can be weighted according to its importance. We improve the accuracy by giving more weights on subtrees that contain the predicate and the argument nodes with this ability. Although Kazama and Torisawa (2005) presented fast training with tree kernels, the slow classification during runtime remained to be solved. In this paper, we give a solution that uses an efficient DP updating procedure applicable in argument recognition. We demonstrate that the WMOLT kernel improves the accuracy, and our speed-up method makes the recognition more than 40 times faster than the naive classification.</Paragraph>
