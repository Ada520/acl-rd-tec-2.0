Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We consider the task of unsupervised lecture segmentation. We formalize segmentation as a graph-partitioning task that optimizes the normalized cut criterion. Our approach moves beyond localized comparisons and takes into account long-range cohesion dependencies. Our results demonstrate that global analysis improves the segmentation accuracy and is robust in the presence of speech recognition errors.</Paragraph>
