Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a comparison of two formalisms for representing natural language utterances, namely deep syntactical Tectogrammatical Layer of Functional Generative Description (FGD) and a semantic formalism, MultiNet. We discuss the possible position of MultiNet in the FGD framework and present a preliminary mapping of representational means of these two formalisms.</Paragraph>
