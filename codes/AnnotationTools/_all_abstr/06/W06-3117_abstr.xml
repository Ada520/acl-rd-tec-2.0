Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An important problem that is related to phrase-based statistical translation models is the obtaining of word phrases from an aligned bilingual training corpus. In this work, we propose obtaining word phrases by means of a Stochastic Inversion Translation Grammar. Experiments on the shared task proposed in this workshop with the Europarl corpus have been carried out and good results have been obtained. null</Paragraph>
