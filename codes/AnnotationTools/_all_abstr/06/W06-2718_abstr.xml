Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a standoff annotation framework for the integration of NLP components, currently implemented in the context of the DELPH-IN tools1. This provides a flexible standoff pointer scheme suitable for various types of data, a lattice encodes structural ambiguity, intra-annotation relationships are encoded, and annotations are decorated with structured content. We provide an XML serialization for intercomponent communication.</Paragraph>
