Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a corpus-based account of structural priming in human sentence processing, focusing on the role that syntactic representations play in such an account. We estimate the strength of structural priming effects from a corpus of spontaneous spoken dialogue, annotated syntactically with Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) derivations. This methodology allows us to test a range of predictions that CCG makes about priming. In particular, we present evidence for priming between lexical and syntactic categories encoding partially satisfied sub-categorization frames, and we show that priming effects exist both for incremental and normal-form CCG derivations.</Paragraph>
