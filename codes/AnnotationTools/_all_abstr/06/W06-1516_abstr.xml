Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we introduce SEMTAG, a toolbox for TAG-based parsing and generation. This environment supports the development of wide-coverage grammars and differs from existing environments for TAG such as XTAG, (XTAG-Research-Group, 2001) in that it includes a semantic dimension. SEMTAG is open-source and freely available.</Paragraph>
