Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a learning framework for structured support vector models in which boosting and bagging methods are used to construct ensemble models. We also propose a selection method which is based on a switching model among a set of outputs of individual classifiers when dealing with natural language parsing problems. The switching model uses subtrees mined from the corpus and a boosting-based algorithm to select the most appropriate output. The application of the proposed framework on the domain of semantic parsing shows advantages in comparison with the original large margin methods.</Paragraph>
