Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> On the World Wide Web, the volume of subjective information, such as opinions and reviews, has been increasing rapidly.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The trends and rules latent in a large set of subjective descriptions can potentially be useful for decision-making purposes. In this paper, we propose a method for summarizing subjective descriptions, specifically opinions in Japanese. We visualize the pro and con arguments for a target topic, such as &amp;quot;Should Japan introduce the summertime system?&amp;quot; Users can summarize the arguments about the topic in order to choose a more reasonable standpoint for decision making. We evaluate our system, called &amp;quot;OpinionReader&amp;quot;, experimentally.</Paragraph>
