</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a novel framework for using scenario knowledge in open-domain Question Answering (Q/A) applications that uses a state-of-the-art textual entailment system (Hickl et al., 2006b) in order to discover textual information relevant to the set of topics associated with a scenario description. An intrinsic and an extrinsic evaluation of this method is presented in the context of an automatic Q/A system and results from several user scenarios are discussed.</Paragraph>
