</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> General information retrieval systems are designed to serve all users without considering individual needs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to personalized search. It can, in a unified way, exploit and utilize implicit feedback information, such as query logs and immediately viewed documents. Moreover, our approach can implement result re-ranking and query expansion simultaneously and collaboratively. Based on this approach, we develop a client-side personalized web search agent PAIR (Personalized Assistant for Information Retrieval), which supports both English and Chinese. Our experiments on TREC and HTRDP collections clearly show that the new approach is both effective and efficient.</Paragraph>
