Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Words and character-bigrams are both used as features in Chinese text processing tasks, but no systematic comparison or analysis of their values as features for Chinese text categorization has been reported heretofore. We carry out here a full performance comparison between them by experiments on various document collections (including a manually word-segmented corpus as a golden standard), and a semi-quantitative analysis to elucidate the characteristics of their behavior; and try to provide some preliminary clue for feature term choice (in most cases, character-bigrams are better than words) and dimensionality setting in text categorization systems.</Paragraph>
