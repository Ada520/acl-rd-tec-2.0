Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We target the problem of linking source mentions that belong to the same entity (source coreference resolution), which is needed for creating opinion summaries. In this paper we describe how source coreference resolution can be transformed into standard noun phrase coreference resolution, apply a state-of-the-art coreference resolution approach to the transformed data, and evaluate on an available corpus of manually annotated opinions.</Paragraph>
