Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The goal of this paper is to show how to accomplish a more enjoyable and enthusiastic dialogue through the analysis of human-to-human conversational dialogues. We first created a conversational dialogue corpus annotated with two types of tags: one type indicates the particular aspects of the utterance itself, while the other indicates the degree of enthusiasm. We then investigated the relationship between these tags. Our results indicate that affective and cooperative utterances are significant to enthusiastic dialogue.</Paragraph>
