Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an initial investigation into the use of a metagrammar for explicitly sharing abstract grammatical specifications among languages. We define a single class hierarchy for a metagrammar which allows us to automatically generate grammars for different languages from a single compact metagrammar hierarchy.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We use as our linguistic example the verb-second phenomenon, which shows considerable variation while retaining a basic property, namely the fact that the verb can appear in one of two positions in the clause.</Paragraph>
