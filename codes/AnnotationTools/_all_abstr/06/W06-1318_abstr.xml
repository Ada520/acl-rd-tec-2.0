</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a first analysis of inter-annotator agreement for the DIT++ tagset of dialogue acts, a comprehensive, layered, multidimensional set of 86 tags.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Within a dimension or a layer, subsets of tags are often hierarchically organised. We argue that especially for such highly structured annotation schemes the well-known kappa statistic is not an adequate measure of inter-annotator agreement. Instead, we propose a statistic that takes the structural properties of the tagset into account, and we discuss the application of this statistic in an annotation experiment. The experiment shows promising agreement scores for most dimensions in the tagset and provides useful insights into the usability of the annotation scheme, but also indicates that several additional factors influence annotator agreement. We finally suggest that the proposed approach for measuring agreement per dimension can be a good basis for measuring annotator agreement over the dimensions of a multidimensional annotation scheme.</Paragraph>
