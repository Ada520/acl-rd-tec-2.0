Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We are presenting a new, hybrid alignment architecture for aligning bilingual, linguistically annotated parallel corpora.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It is able to align simultaneously at paragraph, sentence, phrase and word level, using statistical and heuristic cues, along with linguistics-based rules. The system currently aligns English and German texts, and the linguistic annotation used covers POS-tags, lemmas and syntactic constitutents. However, as the system is highly modular, we can easily adapt it to new language pairs and other types of annotation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The hybrid nature of the system allows experiments with a variety of alignment cues to find solutions to word alignment problems like the correct alignment of rare words and multiwords, or how to align despite syntactic differences between two languages.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> First performance tests are promising, and we are setting up a gold standard for a thorough evaluation of the system.</Paragraph>
