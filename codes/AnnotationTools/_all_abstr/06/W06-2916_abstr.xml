Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Distributional approaches to grammar induction are typically inefficient, enumerating large numbers of candidate constituents. In this paper, we describe a simplified model of distributional analysis which uses heuristics to reduce the number of candidate constituents under consideration. We apply this model to a large corpus of over 400000 words of written English, and evaluate the results using EVALB. We show that the performance of this approach is limited, providing a detailed analysis of learned structure and a comparison with actual constituent-context distributions. This motivates a more structured approach, using a process of attachment to form constituents from their distributional components. Our findings suggest that distributional methods do not generalize enough to learn syntax effectively from raw text, but that attachment methods are more successful.</Paragraph>
