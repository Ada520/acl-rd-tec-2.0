Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Our approach to dependency parsing is based on the linear model of McDonald et al.(McDonald et al., 2005b). Instead of solving the linear model using the Maximum Spanning Tree algorithm we propose an incremental Integer Linear Programming formulation of the problem that allows us to enforce linguistic constraints.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our results show only marginal improvements over the non-constrained parser. In addition to the fact that many parses did not violate any constraints in the first place this can be attributed to three reasons: 1) the next best solution that fulfils the constraints yields equal or less accuracy, 2) noisy POS tags and 3) occasionally our inference algorithm was too slow and decoding timed out.</Paragraph>
