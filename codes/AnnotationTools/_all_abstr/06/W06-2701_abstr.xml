Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes our approach to representing and querying multi-dimensional, possibly overlapping text annotations, as used in our question answering (QA) system. We use a system extending XQuery, the W3C-standard XML query language, with new axes that allow one to jump easily between different annotations of the same data. The new axes are formulated in termsof(partial)overlapandcontainment.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> All annotations are made using stand-off XML in a single document, which can be efficiently queried using the XQuery extension. The system is scalable to gigabytes of XML annotations. We show examples of the system in QA scenarios.</Paragraph>
