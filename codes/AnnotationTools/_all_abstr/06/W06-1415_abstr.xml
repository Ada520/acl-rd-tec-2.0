Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a question-answering system on the Web which aims at generating intelligent answers to numerical questions. These answers are generated in a cooperative way: besides a direct answer, comments are generated to explain to the user the variation of numerical data extracted from the Web. We present the content determination and realisation tasks. We also present some elements of evaluation with respect to end-users.</Paragraph>
