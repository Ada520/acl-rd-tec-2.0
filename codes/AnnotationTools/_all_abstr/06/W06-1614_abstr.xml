Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a comparative study of probabilistic treebank parsing of German, using the Negra and T&amp;quot;uBa-D/Z treebanks. Experiments with the Stanford parser, which uses a factored PCFG and dependency model, show that, contrary to previous claims for other parsers, lexicalization of PCFG models boosts parsing performance for both treebanks. The experiments also show that there is a big difference in parsing performance, when trained on the Negra and on the T&amp;quot;uBa-D/Z treebanks. Parser performance for the models trained on T&amp;quot;uBa-D/Z are comparable to parsing results for English with the Stanford parser, when trained on the Penn treebank. This comparison at least suggests that German is not harder to parse than its West-Germanic neighbor language English.</Paragraph>
