Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Recent advances in text analysis have led to finer-grained semantic analysis, including automatic sentiment analysis--the task of measuring documents, or chunks of text, based on emotive categories, such as positive or negative. However, considerably less progress has been made on efficient ways of exploring these measurements. This paper discusses approaches for visualizing the affective content of documents and describes an interactive capability for exploring emotion in a large document collection.</Paragraph>
