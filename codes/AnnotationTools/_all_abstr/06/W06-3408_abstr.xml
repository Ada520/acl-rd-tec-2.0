Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a system for analyzing conversational data. The system includes state-of-the-art natural language processing components that have been modified to accommodate the unique nature of conversational data. In addition, we leverage the added richness of conversational data by analyzing various aspects of the participants and their relationships to each other. Our tool provides users with the ability to easily identify topics or persons of interest, including who talked to whom, when, entities that were discussed, etc. Using this tool, one can also isolate more complex networks of information: individuals who may have discussed the same topics but never talked to each other. The tool includes a UI that plots information over time, and a semantic graph that highlights relationships of interest.</Paragraph>
