Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a semantic model for Chinese garden-path sentences. Based on the Sentence Degeneration model of HNC theory, a garden-path can arise from two types of ambiguities: SD type ambiguity and NP allocated ambiguity.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This paper provides an approach to process garden-paths, in which ambiguity detection and analysis take the place of revision. The performance of the approach is evaluated on a small manually annotated test set. The results show that our algorithm can analyze Chinese garden-path sentences effectively.</Paragraph>
