Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a system for translating named entities from Basque to Spanish based on comparable corpora.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> For that purpose we have tried two approaches: one based on Basque linguistic features, and a language-independent tool. For both tools we have used Basque-Spanish comparable corpora, a bilingual dictionary and the web as resources.</Paragraph>
