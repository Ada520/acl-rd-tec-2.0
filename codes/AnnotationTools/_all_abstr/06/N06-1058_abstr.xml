</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper studies the impact of paraphrases on the accuracy of automatic evaluation. Given a reference sentence and a machine-generated sentence, we seek to nd a paraphrase of the reference sentence that is closer in wording to the machine output than the original reference.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We apply our paraphrasing method in the context of machine translation evaluation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Our experiments show that the use of a paraphrased synthetic reference re nes the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We also found a strong connection between the quality of automatic paraphrases as judged by humans and their contribution to automatic evaluation.</Paragraph>
