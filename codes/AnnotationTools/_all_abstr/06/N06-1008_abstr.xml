Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper shows that inference rules with temporal constraints can be acquired by using verb-verb co-occurrences in Japanese coordinated sentences and verb-noun cooccurrences. For example, our unsupervised acquisition method could obtain the inference rule If someone enforces a law, usually someone enacts the law at the same time as or before the enforcing of the law since the verbs enact and enforce frequently co-occurred in coordinated sentences and the verbs also frequently co-occurred with the noun law. We also show that the accuracy of the acquisition is improved by using the occurrence frequency of a single verb, which we assume indicates how generic the meaning of the verb is.</Paragraph>
