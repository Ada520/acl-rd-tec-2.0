Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> While most work on parsing with PCFGs has focused on local correlations between tree configurations, we attempt to model non-local correlations using a finite mixture of PCFGs. A mixture grammar fit with the EM algorithm shows improvement over a single PCFG, both in parsing accuracy and in test data likelihood. We argue that this improvement comes from the learning of specialized grammars that capture non-local correlations.</Paragraph>
