Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a novel context pattern induction method for information extraction, specifically named entity extraction. Using this method, we extended several classes of seed entity lists into much larger high-precision lists. Using token membership in these extended lists as additional features, we improved the accuracy of a conditional random field-based named entity tagger. In contrast, features derived from the seed lists decreased extractor accuracy. null</Paragraph>
