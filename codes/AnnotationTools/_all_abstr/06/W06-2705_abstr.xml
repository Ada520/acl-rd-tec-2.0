Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents the compilation of the CroCo Corpus, an English-German translation corpus. Corpus design, annotation and alignment are described in detail. In order to guarantee the searchability and exchangeability of the corpus, XML stand-off mark-up is used as representation format for the multi-layer annotation. On this basis it is shown how the corpus can be queried using XQuery.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Furthermore, the generalisation of results in terms of linguistic and translational research questions is briefly discussed.</Paragraph>
