Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper examines two problems in document-level sentiment analysis: (1) determining whether a given document is a review or not, and (2) classifying the polarity of a review as positive or negative.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We first demonstrate that review identification can be performed with high accuracy using only unigrams as features. We then examine the role of four types of simple linguistic knowledge sources in a polarity classification system.</Paragraph>
