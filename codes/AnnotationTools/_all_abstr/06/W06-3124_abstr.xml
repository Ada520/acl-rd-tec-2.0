Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The Microsoft Research translation system is a syntactically informed phrasal SMT system that uses a phrase translation model based on dependency treelets and a global reordering model based on the source dependency tree. These models are combined with several other knowledge sources in a log-linear manner. The weights of the individual components in the log-linear model are set by an automatic parametertuning method. We give a brief overview of the components of the system and discuss our experience with the Europarl data translating from English to Spanish.</Paragraph>
