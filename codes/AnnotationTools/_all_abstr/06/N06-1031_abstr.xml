Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We identify problems with the Penn Tree-bank that render it imperfect for syntax-based machine translation and propose methods of relabeling the syntax trees to improve translation quality. We develop a system incorporating a handful of relabeling strategies that yields a statistically signi cant improvement of 2.3 BLEU points over a baseline syntax-based system.</Paragraph>
