Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we propose and investigate Ontology Population from Textual Mentions (OPTM), a sub-task of Ontology Population from text where we assume that mentions for several kinds of entities (e.g. PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, GEO-POLITICAL_ ENTITY) are already extracted from a document collection. On the one hand, OPTM simplifies the general Ontology Population task, limiting the input textual material; on the other hand, it introduces challenging extensions to Ontology Population restricted to named entities, being open to a wider spectrum of linguistic phenomena.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We describe a manually created benchmark for OPTM and discuss several factors which determine the difficulty of the task.</Paragraph>
