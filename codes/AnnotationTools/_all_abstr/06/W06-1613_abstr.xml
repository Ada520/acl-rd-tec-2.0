Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Citation function is de ned as the author's reason for citing a given paper (e.g. acknowledgement of the use of the cited method). The automatic recognition of the rhetorical function of citations in scienti c text has many applications, from improvement of impact factor calculations to text summarisation and more informative citation indexers. We show that our annotation scheme for citation function is reliable, and present a supervised machine learning framework to automatically classify citation function, using both shallow and linguistically-inspired features. We nd, amongst other things, a strong relationship between citation function and sentiment classi cation.</Paragraph>
