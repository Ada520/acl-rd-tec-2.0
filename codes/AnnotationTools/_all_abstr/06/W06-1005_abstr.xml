Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we discuss the development of a multilingual collocation dictionary for translation purposes. By 'collocation' we mean not only set or fixed expressions including idioms, simple co-occurrences of items and metaphorical uses, but also translators' paraphrases.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We approach this problem from two directions. Firstly we identify certain linguistic phenomena and lexicographical requirements that need to be respected in the development of such dictionaries.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The second and other direction concerns the development of such dictionaries in which linguistic phenomena and lexicographic attributes are themselves a means of access to the collocations. The linguistic phenomena and lexicographical requirements concern variously placing the sense of collocations rather than head-words or other access methods at the centre of interest, together with collocation synonymy and translation equivalence, polysemy and non-reversibility of the lexis, and other more lexicographic properties such as varieties of language and regionalisms, and types of translation.</Paragraph>
