Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> It would be useful to enable dialogue agents to project, through linguistic means, their individuality or personality.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Equally, each member of a pair of agents ought to adjust its language (to a greater or lesser extent) to match that of its interlocutor. We describe CRAG, which generates dialogues between pairs of agents, who are linguistically distinguishable, but able to align. CRAG-2 makes use of OPENCCG and an over-generation and ranking approach, guided by a set of language models covering both personality and alignment. We illustrate with examples of output, and briefly note results from user studies with the earlier CRAG-1, indicating how CRAG-2 will be further evaluated.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Related work is discussed, along with current limitations and future directions.</Paragraph>
