<Paragraph position="0"> Information Extraction (IE) is a fundamental technology for NLP. Previous methods for IE were relying on co-occurrence relations, soft patterns and properties of the target (for example, syntactic role), which result in problems of handling paraphrasing and alignment of instances. Our system ARE (Anchor and Relation) is based on the dependency relation model and tackles these problems by unifying entities according to their dependency relations, which we found to provide more invariant relations between entities in many cases. In order to exploit the complexity and characteristics of relation paths, we further classify the relation paths into the categories of 'easy', 'average' and 'hard', and utilize different extraction strategies based on the characteristics of those categories. Our extraction method leads to improvement in performance by 3% and 6% for MUC4 and MUC6 respectively as compared to the state-of-art IE systems.</Paragraph>
