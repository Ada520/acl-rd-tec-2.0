Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a small set of attachment heuristics for postnominal PPs occurring in full-text articles related to enzymes.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A detailed analysis of the results suggests their utility for extraction of relations expressed by nominalizations (often with several attached PPs). The system achieves 82% accuracy on a manually annotated test corpus of over 3000 PPs from varied biomedical texts.</Paragraph>
