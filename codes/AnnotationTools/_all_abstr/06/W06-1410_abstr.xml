Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The natural language generation literature provides many algorithms for the generation of referring expressions. In this paper, we explore the question of whether these algorithms actually produce the kinds of expressions that people produce. We compare the output of three existing algorithms against a data set consisting of human-generated referring expressions, and identify a number of significant differences between what people do and what these algorithms do. On the basis of these observations, we suggest some ways forward that attempt to address these differences. null</Paragraph>
