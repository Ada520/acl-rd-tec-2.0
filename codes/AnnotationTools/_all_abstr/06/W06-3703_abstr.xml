</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> S-MINDS is a speech translation engine, which allows an English speaker to communicate with a non-English speaker easily within a question-and-answer, interview-style format.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It can handle limited dialogs such as medical triage or hospital admissions. We have built and tested an English-Korean system for doing medical triage with a translation accuracy of 79.8% (for English) and 78.3% (for Korean) for all non-rejected utterances. We will give an overview of the system building process and the quantitative and qualitatively system performance.</Paragraph>
