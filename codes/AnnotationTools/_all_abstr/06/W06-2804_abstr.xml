Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper is a presentation of a doctoral research in progress focused on a new genre: online encyclopaedias. The introduction to Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica Online will be followed by a presentation of wiki as a new textual genre. Wikipedia analysis will focus firstly on the investigation of the &amp;quot;WikiLanguage&amp;quot;, the language used in official encyclopaedic articles.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Secondly, the &amp;quot;WikiSpeak&amp;quot;, the spoken-written language used by Wikipedians in their backstage and informal community, will be taken into account. The initial findings of this research seem to suggest that, the language of the Wikipedia's co-authored articles is formal and standardized in a way similar to that found in Encyclopaedia Britannica Online. By contrast, the WikiSpeak, as a new variety of NetSpeak Jargon, can be considered as a creative domain, an independent and individual expression of linguistic freedom of selfrepresentation, characterizing the wiki Computer Mediated Discourse Community.</Paragraph>
