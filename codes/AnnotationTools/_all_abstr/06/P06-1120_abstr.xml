Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper focuses on the use of advanced techniques of text analysis as support for collocation extraction. A hybrid system is presented that combines statistical methods and multilingual parsing for detecting accurate collocational information from English, French, Spanish and Italian corpora. The advantage of relying on full parsing over using a traditional window method (which ignores the syntactic information) is first theoretically motivated, then empirically validated by a comparative evaluation experiment.</Paragraph>
