Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a novel method to identify effective surface text patterns using an internet search engine. Precision is only one of the criteria to identify the most effective patterns among the candidates found.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph position="2"> Also, a pattern has to relate diverse instances if it expresses a non-functional relation. The learned surface text patterns are applied in an ontology population algorithm, which not only learns new instances of classes but also new instance-pairs of relations. We present some PSrst experiments with these methods.</Paragraph>
