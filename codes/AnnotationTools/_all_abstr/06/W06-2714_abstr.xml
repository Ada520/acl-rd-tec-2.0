Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present the Heart of Gold middleware by demonstrating three XML-based integration scenarios where multi-dimensional markup produced online by multilingual natural language processing (NLP) components is combined to deliver rich, robust linguistic markup for use in NLP-based applications like information extraction, question answering and semantic web. The scenarios include (1) robust deep-shallow integration, (2) shallow processing cascades, and (3) treebank storage of multi-dimensionally annotated texts.</Paragraph>
