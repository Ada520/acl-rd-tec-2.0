Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe the new release of the RASP (robust accurate statistical parsing) system, designed for syntactic annotation of free text. The new version includes a revised and more semantically-motivated output representation, an enhanced grammar and part-of-speech tagger lexicon, and a more flexible and semi-supervised training method for the structural parse ranking model. We evaluate the released version on the WSJ using a relational evaluation scheme, and describe how the new release allows users to enhance performance using (in-domain) lexical information.</Paragraph>
