Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, structures involving the raising verb seem, are examined. Specifically, it is shown that previously-proposed elementary trees for seem with an experiencer argument are inadequate, based upon syntactic testing. In Storoshenko (2006), new articulated structures for the seem predicate are proposed, modelled upon the treatment of ditransitive verbs. This paper recapitulates and further motivates the ditransitive-style analysis, while illustrating its potential value in issues surrounding extraction and the raising construction in TAG.</Paragraph>
