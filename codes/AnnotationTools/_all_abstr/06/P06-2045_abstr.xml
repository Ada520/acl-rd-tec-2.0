Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a collaborative framework for collecting Thai unknown words found on Web pages over the Internet. Our main goal is to design and construct a Web-based system which allows a group of interested users to participate in constructing a Thai unknown-word open dictionary. The proposed framework provides supporting algorithms and tools for automatically identifying and extracting unknown words from Web pages of given URLs.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The system yields the result of unknown-word candidates which are presented to the users for verification. The approved unknown words could be combined with the set of existing words in the lexicon to improve the performance of many NLP tasks such as word segmentation, information retrieval and machine translation. Our framework includes word segmentation and morphological analysis modules for handling the non-segmenting characteristic of Thai written language. To take advantage of large available text resource on the Web, our unknown-word boundary identification approach is based on the statistical string pattern-matching algorithm. Keywords: Unknown words, open dictionary, word segmentation, morphological analysis, word-boundary detection.</Paragraph>
