Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An HMM-based Single Character Recovery (SCR) Model is proposed in this paper to extract a large set of &amp;quot;atomic abbreviation pairs&amp;quot;from a large text corpus. By an&amp;quot;atomic abbreviation pair,&amp;quot;it refers to an abbreviated word and its root word (i.e., unabbreviated form) in which the abbreviation is a single Chinese character.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This task is interesting since the abbreviation process for Chinese compound words seems to be &amp;quot;compositional&amp;quot;; in other words, one can often decode an abbreviated word, such as&amp;quot;Tai Da &amp;quot;(Taiwan University), character-by-character back to its root form. With a large atomic abbreviation dictionary, one may be able to recover multiple-character abbreviations more easily.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> With only a few training iterations, the acquisition accuracy of the proposed SCR model achieves 62% and 50 % precision for training set and test set, respectively, from the ASWSC-2001 corpus.</Paragraph>
