Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Combination methods are an effective way of improving system performance. This paper examines the bene ts of system combination for unsupervised WSD. We investigate several voting- and arbiter-based combination strategies over a diverse pool of unsupervised WSD systems.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our combination methods rely on predominant senses which are derived automatically from raw text. Experiments using the SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets demonstrate that our ensembles yield signi cantly better results when compared with state-of-the-art.</Paragraph>
