Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a study of the patterns of translational equivalence exhibited by a variety of bitexts. The study found that the complexity of these patterns in every bitext was higher than suggested in the literature. These findings shed new light on why &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot; constraints have not helped to improve statistical translation models, including finite-state phrase-based models, tree-to-string models, and tree-to-tree models. The paper also presents evidence that inversion transduction grammars cannot generate some translational equivalence relations, even in relatively simple real bi-texts in syntactically similar languages with rigid word order.
