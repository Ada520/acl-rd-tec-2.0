Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we study the utility of discourse structure for spoken dialogue performance modeling. We experiment with various ways of exploiting the discourse structure: in isolation, as context information for other factors (correctness and certainty) and through trajectories in the discourse structure hierarchy. Our correlation and PARADISE results show that, while the discourse structure is not useful in isolation, using the discourse structure as context information for other factors or via trajectories produces highly predictive parameters for performance analysis.</Paragraph>
