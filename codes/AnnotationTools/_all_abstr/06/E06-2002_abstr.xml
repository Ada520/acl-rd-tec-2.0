Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a multi-lingual phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation system accessible by means of a Web page. The user can issue translation requests from Arabic, Chinese or Spanish into English. The same phrase-based statistical technology is employed to realize the three supported language-pairs. New language-pairs can be easily added to the demonstrator. The Web-based interface allows the use of the translation system to any computer connected to the Internet.</Paragraph>
