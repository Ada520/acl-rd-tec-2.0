</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents two word segmentation (WS) systems and a named entity recognition (NER) system in France Telecom R&amp;D Beijing. The one system of WS is for open tracks based on n-gram language model and another one is for closed tracks based on maximum entropy approach. The NER system uses a hybrid algorithm based on Class-based language model and rule-based knowledge. These systems are all augmented with a set of post-processors.</Paragraph>
