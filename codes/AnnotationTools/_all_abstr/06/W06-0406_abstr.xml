Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In spite of its potential for bidirectionality, Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG) has so far been used almost exclusively for parsing. This paper represents one of the first steps towards an XDG-based integrated generation architecture by tackling what is arguably the most basic among generation tasks: lexicalization. Herein we present a constraint-based account of disjunction in lexicalization, i.e. a way to enable an XDG grammar to generate all paraphrases -- along the lexicalization axis, of course -- realizing a given input semantics. Our model is (i) efficient, yielding strong propagation, (ii) modular and (iii) favourable to synergy inasmuch as it allows collaboration between modules, notably semantics and syntax.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We focus on constraints ensuring well-formedness and completeness and avoiding over-redundancy.</Paragraph>
