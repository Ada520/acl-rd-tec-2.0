Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We study a number of natural language decipherment problems using unsupervised learning. These include letter substitution ciphers, character code conversion, phonetic decipherment, and word-based ciphers with relevance to machine translation. Straightforward unsupervised learning techniques most often fail on the rst try, so we describe techniques for understanding errors and signi cantly increasing performance.</Paragraph>
