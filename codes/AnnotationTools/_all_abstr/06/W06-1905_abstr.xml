Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe the extension of an existing monolingual QA system for English-to-Chinese and English-to-Japanese cross-lingual question answering (CLQA). We also attempt to characterize the influence of translation on CLQA performance through experimental evaluation and analysis. The paper also describes some language-specific issues for keyword translation in CLQA.</Paragraph>
