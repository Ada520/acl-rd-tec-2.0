Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Current parsing models are not immediately applicable for languages that exhibit strong interaction between morphology and syntax, e.g., Modern Hebrew (MH), Arabic and other Semitic languages. This work represents a rst attempt at modeling morphological-syntactic interaction in a generative probabilistic framework to allow for MH parsing. We show that morphological information selected in tandem with syntactic categories is instrumental for parsing Semitic languages. We further show that redundant morphological information helps syntactic disambiguation.</Paragraph>
