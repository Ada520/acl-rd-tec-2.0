Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We analyze estimation methods for Data-Oriented Parsing, as well as the theoretical criteria used to evaluate them. We show that all current estimation methods areinconsistent inthe &amp;quot;weight-distribution test&amp;quot;, and argue that these results force us to rethink both the methods proposed and the criteria used.</Paragraph>
