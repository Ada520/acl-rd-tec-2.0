Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an unsupervised topic identification method integrating linguistic and visual information based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We employ HMMs for topic identification, wherein a state corresponds to a topic and various features including linguistic, visual and audio information are observed. Our experiments on two kinds of cooking TV programs show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</Paragraph>
