Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, a generic system that generates parsers from parsing schemata is applied to the particular case of the XTAG English grammar. In order to be able to generate XTAG parsers, some transformations are made to the grammar, and TAG parsing schemata are extended with feature structure unification support and a simple tree filtering mechanism. The generated implementations allow us to study the performance of different TAG parsers when working with a large-scale, wide-coverage grammar.</Paragraph>
