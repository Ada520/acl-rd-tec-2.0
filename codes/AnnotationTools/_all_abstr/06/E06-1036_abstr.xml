</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Detection of discourse structure is crucial in many text-based applications. This paper presents an original framework for describing textual parallelism which allows us to generalize various discourse phenomena and to propose a unique method to recognize them. With this prospect, we discuss several methods in order to identify the most appropriate one for the problem, and evaluate them based on a manually annotated corpus.</Paragraph>
