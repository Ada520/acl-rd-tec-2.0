Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> How can proteins fold so quickly into their unique native structures? We show here that there is a natural analogy between parsing and the protein folding problem, and demonstrate that CKY can find the native structures of a simplified lattice model of proteins with high accuracy.</Paragraph>
