Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present in this paper a parser relying on a constraint-based formalism called Property Grammar. We show how constraints constitute an efficient solution in parsing non canonical material such as spoken language transcription or e-mails.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This technique, provided that it is implemented with some control mechanisms, is very efficient. Some results are presented, from the French parsing evaluation campaign EASy.</Paragraph>
