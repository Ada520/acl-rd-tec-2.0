Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Most of the work on treebank-based statistical parsing exclusively uses the Wall-Street-Journal part of the Penn treebank for evaluation purposes. Due to the presence of this quasi-standard, the question of to which degree parsing results depend on the properties of treebanks was often ignored. In this paper, we use two similar German treebanks, T&amp;quot;uBa-D/Z and NeGra, and investigate the role that different annotation decisions play for parsing. For these purposes, we approximate the two treebanks by gradually taking out or inserting the corresponding annotation components and test the performance of a standard PCFG parser on all treebank versions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our results give an indication of which structures are favorable for parsing and which ones are not.</Paragraph>
