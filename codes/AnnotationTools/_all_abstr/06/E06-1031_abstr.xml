Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Most state-of-the-art evaluation measures for machine translation assign high costs to movements of word blocks. In many cases though such movements still result in correct or almost correct sentences. In this paper, we will present a new evaluation measure which explicitly models block reordering as an edit operation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our measure can be exactly calculated in quadratic time.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Furthermore, we will show how some evaluation measures can be improved by the introduction of word-dependent substitution costs. The correlation of the new measure with human judgment has been investigated systematically on two different language pairs. The experimental results will show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in sentence-level correlation. Results from experiments with word dependent substitution costs will demonstrate an additional increase of correlation between automatic evaluation measures and human judgment.</Paragraph>
