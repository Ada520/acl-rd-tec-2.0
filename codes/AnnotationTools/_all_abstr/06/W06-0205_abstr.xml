Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Lexical Chains are powerful representations of documents. In particular, they have successfully been used in the field of Automatic Text Summarization. However, until now, Lexical Chaining algorithms have only been proposed for English. In this paper, we propose a greedy Language-Independent algorithm that automatically extracts Lexical Chains from texts. For that purpose, we build a hierarchical lexico-semantic knowledge base from a collection of texts by using the Pole-Based Overlapping Clustering Algorithm. As a consequence, our methodology can be applied to any language and proposes a solution to language-dependent Lexical Chainers.</Paragraph>
