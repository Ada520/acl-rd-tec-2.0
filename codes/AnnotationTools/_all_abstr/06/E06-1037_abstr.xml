Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Given the growing complexity of tasks that spoken dialogue systems are trying to handle, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been increasingly used as a way of automatically learning the best policy for a system to make. While most work has focused on generating better policies for a dialogue manager, very little work has been done in using RLto construct abetter dialogue state. This paper presents a RL approach for determining what dialogue features are important to a spoken dialogue tutoring system. Our experiments show that incorporating dialogue factors such as dialogue acts, emotion, repeated concepts and performance play a significant role in tutoring and should be taken into account when designing dialogue systems. null</Paragraph>
