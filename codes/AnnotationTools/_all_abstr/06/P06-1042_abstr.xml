Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce an error mining technique for automatically detecting errors in resources that are used in parsing systems.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We applied this technique on parsing results produced on several million words by two distinct parsing systems, which share the syntactic lexicon and the pre-parsing processing chain. We were thus able to identify missing and erroneous information in these resources.</Paragraph>
