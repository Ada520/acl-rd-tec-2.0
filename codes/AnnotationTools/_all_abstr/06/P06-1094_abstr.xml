Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper presents a new model for context-dependent interpretation of linguistic expressions about spatial proximity between objects in a natural scene. The paper discusses novel psycholinguistic experimental data that tests and verifies the model. The model has been implemented, and enables a conversational robot to identify objects in a scene through topological spatial relations (e.g. &amp;quot;X near Y&amp;quot;). The model can help motivate the choice between topological and projective prepositions.</Paragraph>
