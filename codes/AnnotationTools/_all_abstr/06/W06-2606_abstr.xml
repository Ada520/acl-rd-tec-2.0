Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We investigate methods that add syntactically motivated features to a statistical machine translation system in a reranking framework. Thegoalistoanalyzewhether shallow parsing techniques help in identifying ungrammatical hypotheses. We show that improvements are possible by utilizing supertagging, lightweight dependency analysis, a link grammar parser and a maximum-entropy based chunk parser.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Adding features to n-best lists and discriminatively training the system on a development set increases the BLEU score up to 0.7% on the test set.</Paragraph>
