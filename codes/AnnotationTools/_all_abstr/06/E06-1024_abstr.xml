</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we address the problem of reducing the unpredictability of user-initiated dialogue contributions in human-computer interaction without explicitly restricting the user's interactive possibilities. We demonstrate that it is possible to identify conditions under which particular classes of user-initiated contributions will occur and discuss consequences for dialogue system design.</Paragraph>
