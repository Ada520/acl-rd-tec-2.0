Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Syntactic priming effects, modelled as increase in repetition probability shortly after a use of a syntactic rule, have the potential to improve language processing components. We model priming of syntactic rules in annotated corpora of spoken dialogue, extending previous work that was confined to selected constructions. We find that speakers are more receptive to priming from their interlocutor in task-oriented dialogue than in sponaneous conversation. Low-frequency rules are more likely to show priming.</Paragraph>
