Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a backoff model for phrase-based machine translation that translates unseen word forms in foreign-language text by hierarchical morphological abstractions at the word and the phrase level. The model is evaluated on the Europarl corpus for German-English and Finnish-English translation and shows improvements over state-of-the-art phrase-based models.</Paragraph>
