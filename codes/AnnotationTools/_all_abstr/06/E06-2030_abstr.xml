Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We report work1 in progress on adding affect-detection to an existing program for virtual dramatic improvisation, monitored by a human director. To partially automate the directors' functions, we have partially implemented the detection of emotions, etc. in users' text input, by means of pattern-matching, robust parsing and some semantic analysis. The work also involves basic research into how affect is conveyed by metaphor.</Paragraph>
