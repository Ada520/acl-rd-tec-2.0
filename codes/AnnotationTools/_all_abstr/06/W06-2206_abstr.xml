Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present two methods for semi-automatic detection and correction of errors in textual databases. The first method (horizontal correction) aims at correcting inconsistent values within a database record, while the second (vertical correction) focuses on values which were entered in the wrong column. Both methods are data-driven and language-independent.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We utilise supervised machine learning, but the training data is obtained automatically from the database; no manual annotation is required. Our experiments show that a significant proportion of errors can be detected by the two methods. Furthermore, both methods were found to lead to a precision that is high enough to make semi-automatic error correction feasible.</Paragraph>
