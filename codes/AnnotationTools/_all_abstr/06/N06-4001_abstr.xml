Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce a new interactive corpus exploration tool called InfoMagnets. InfoMagnets aims at making exploratory corpus analysis accessible to researchers who are not experts in text mining. As evidence of its usefulness and usability, it has been used successfully in a research context to uncover relationships between language and behavioral patterns in two distinct domains: tutorial dialogue (Kumar et al., submitted) and on-line communities (Arguello et al., 2006). As an educational tool, it has been used as part of a unit on protocol analysis in an Educational Research Methods course.</Paragraph>
