Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We investigate the utility of supertag information for guiding an existing dependency parser of German. Using weighted constraints to integrate the additionally available information, the decision process of the parser is influenced by changing its preferences, without excluding alternative structural interpretations from being considered. The paper reports on a series of experiments using varying models of supertags that significantly increase the parsing accuracy. In addition, an upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved with perfect supertags is estimated.</Paragraph>
