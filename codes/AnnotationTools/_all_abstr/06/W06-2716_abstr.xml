Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The American National Corpus and its annotations are represented in a stand-off XML format compliant with the specifications of ISO TC37 SC4 WG1's Linguistic Anotation Framework. Because few systems that enable search and access of the corpus currently suport stand-off markup, the project has developed a SAX like parser that generates ANC data with annotations in-line, in a variety of output formats.</Paragraph>
