Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The ability to compress sentences while preserving their grammaticality and most of their meaning has recently received much attention. Our work views sentence compression as an optimisation problem.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We develop an integer programming formulation and infer globally optimal compressions in the face of linguistically motivated constraints. We show that such a formulation allows for relatively simple and knowledge-lean compression models that do not require parallel corpora or large-scale resources. The proposed approach yields results comparable and in some cases superior to state-of-the-art.</Paragraph>
