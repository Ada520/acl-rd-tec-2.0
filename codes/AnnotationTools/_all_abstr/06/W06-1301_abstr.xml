Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we deal with learning and forgetting of speech commands in speech dialogue systems. We discuss two mathematical models for learning and four models for forgetting. Furthermore, we describe the experiments used to determine the learning and forgetting curve in our environment. Our findings are compared to the theoretical models and based on this we deduce which models best describe learning and forgetting in our automotive environment. The resulting models are used to develop an adaptive help system for a speech dialogue system. The system provides only relevant context specific information. null</Paragraph>
