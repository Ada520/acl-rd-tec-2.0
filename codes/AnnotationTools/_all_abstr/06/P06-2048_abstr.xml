Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We revisit the idea of history-based parsing, and present a history-based parsing framework that strives to be simple, general, and exible. We also provide a decoder for this probability model that is linear-space, optimal, and anytime. A parser based on this framework, when evaluated on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank, compares favorably with other state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of both accuracy and speed.</Paragraph>
