Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Recent work on Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has shown that to achieve high accuracy a joint inference on the whole predicate argument structure should be applied. In this paper, we used syntactic sub-trees that span potential argument structures of the target predicate in tree kernel functions. This allows Support Vector Machines to discern between correct and incorrect predicate structures and to re-rank them based on the joint probability of their arguments. Experiments on the PropBank data show that both classification and re-ranking based on tree kernels can improve SRL systems.</Paragraph>
