</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Case-based machine translation is a promising ~ppreach to resolving problems in rule-based machine translation systems, such as difficulties in control of rules and low adaptability to specific domains. We propose a new mechanism for case-based machine translation, in which a large set of cases is generalized into a smaller set of cases by using a thesaurus.</Paragraph>
