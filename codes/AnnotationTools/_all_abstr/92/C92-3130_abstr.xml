</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paperdescribes the framework for a new abstraction method that utilizes event-tmits written in sentences. Event-units are expressed in Language Information Structnrc (LIS) form and the projection of LIS from a sentence is f)cffonned by a semantic engine. ABEX (ABstraction EXtraction system) utilizes the LIS outpttt of the semantic engine. ABI';X can extract events from sentences and classify them. Since ABEX and the LIS form nsc only limited knowledge , the system need not construct or nlaintain a large amount of knowledge.</Paragraph>
