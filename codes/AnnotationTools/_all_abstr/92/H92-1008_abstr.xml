ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the AT&amp;T ATIS data collection system, with emphasis on the development of the speech-in, speech-out interaction paradigm. The ATIS task involves providing air travel information to a user in the context of a interactive dialogue. Under the AT&amp;T interaction paradigm, information retrieved from a travel information database in tabular form is automatically transformed into sentences, which are spoken to a user by a speech synthesizer. To date, we have collected over 1800 sentences from subjects who used the system to solve travel planning scenarios. We present a comparison of the ATIS data collected at AT&amp;T with the ATIS data collected at other sites (BBN, CMU, MIT, and SRI), and discuss what we have learned in this prehminary effort.</Paragraph>
