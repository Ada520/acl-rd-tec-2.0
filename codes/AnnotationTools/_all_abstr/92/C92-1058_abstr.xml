Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A general framework for parallel parsing is presented, which allows for a unitied, systematic approach to parallel parsing. The l'rimordial Soup Algorithm creates trees by alh)wing partial parse trees to combine arbitrarily. By adding constraints to the general algorithm, a large, class of parallel parsing strategies can be detined. This is exemplified by CYK, (hot, torn up) Earley and de Vreught &amp; Honig parsers. From such a parsing strategy algorithms for various machine architectures can be derived in a systematic way.</Paragraph>
