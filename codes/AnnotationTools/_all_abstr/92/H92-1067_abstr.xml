ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new search algorithm for very large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Continuous speech recognition with this algorithm is only about 10 times more computationally expensive than isolated word recognition. We report preliminary recognition results obtained by testing our recognizer on &amp;quot;books on tape&amp;quot; using a 60,000 word dictionary.</Paragraph>
