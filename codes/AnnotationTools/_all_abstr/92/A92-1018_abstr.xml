Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an implementation of a part-of-speech tagger based on a hidden Markov model. The methodology enables robust and accurate tagging with few resource requirements. Only a lexicon and some unlabeled training text are required.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Accuracy exceeds 96%. We describe implementation strategies and optimizations which result in high-speed operation. Three applications for tagging are described: phrase recognition; word sense disambiguation; and grammatical function assignment.</Paragraph>
