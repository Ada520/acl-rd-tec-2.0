ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes three relatively domain-independent capabilities recently added to the Paramax spoken language understanding system: non-monotonic reasoning, implicit reference resolution, and database query paraphrase. In addition, we discuss the results of the February 1992 ATIS benchmark tests. We describe a variation on the standard evaluation metric which provides a more tightly controlled measure of progress. Finally, we briefly describe an experiment which we have done in extending the n-best speech/language integration architecture to improving OCR accuracy.</Paragraph>
