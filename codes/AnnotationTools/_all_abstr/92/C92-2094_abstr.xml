Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The task of designing an interlingual machine translation system is difficult, first because the designer must have n knowledge of the principles underlying cross~ linguistic distinctions for the languages under consideration, and second because the designer must then be able to incorporate this knowledge effectively into the system. This paper provides a catalog of several types of distinctions among Spanish, English, and German, and describes a parametric approach that characterizes these distinctions, both at the syntactic level and at the lexical-semantic level. The approach described here is implemented in a system called UNITRAN, a machine translation system that translates English, Spanish, and German bidirectionally.</Paragraph>
