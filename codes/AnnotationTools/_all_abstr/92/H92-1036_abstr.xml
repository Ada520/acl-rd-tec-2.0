ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We discuss maximum a posteriori estimation of continuous density hidden Markov models (CDHMM). The classical MLE reestimation algorithms, namely the forward-backward algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm, are expanded and reestimation formulas are given for HMM with Gaussian mixture observation densities. Because of its adaptive nature, Bayesian learning serves as a unified approach for the following four speech recognition applications, namely parameter smoothing, speaker adaptation, speaker group modeling and corrective ~aining. New experimental results on all four applications are provided to show the effectiveness of the MAP estimation approach.</Paragraph>
