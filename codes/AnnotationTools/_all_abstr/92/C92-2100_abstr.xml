Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a three-level revision model for improving badly-styled Japanese expressions, especially in the field of technical communication. The model is a mixture of the regeneration-based model and tile rewriting-based model. The first level divides tong sentences, while the second level improves several badly-styled expressions with iterative partial rewriting operations. The last level performs regeneration, in which word ordering and punctuation to reduce tile reading ambiguity are currently involvod. Expelimental results show that our model is effective in realizing practical revision support systems.</Paragraph>
