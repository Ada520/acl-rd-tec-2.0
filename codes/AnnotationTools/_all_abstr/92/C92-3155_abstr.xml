Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Italian is a language presenting a lot of syntactical problems, sucb as a rather unrestricted word order, unbounded agreement controls, long distance structure checkings and so on. Things get worse and worse if we pass from &amp;quot;sentences of linguists&amp;quot; to real texts. In this paper we will present a system able to retrieve and signal syntactic errors in real italian texts.</Paragraph>
