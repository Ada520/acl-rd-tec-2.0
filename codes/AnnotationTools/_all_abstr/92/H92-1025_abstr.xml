ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes Picky, a probabilistic agenda-based chart parsing algorithm which uses a technique called probabilistic prediction to predict which grammar rules are likely to lead to an acceptable parse of the input. In tests on randomly selected test data, &amp;quot;Picky generates fewer edges on average than other CKY-like algorithms, while achieving 89~ first parse accuracy and also enabling the parser to process sentences with false starts and other minor disfluencies. Further, sentences which are parsed completely by the probabilistic prediction technique have a 97~0 first parse accuracy.</Paragraph>
