ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present an approach to grammar development where the task is decomposed into two separate subtasks. The first task is hnguistic, with the goal of producing a set of rules that have a large coverage (in the sense that the correct parse is among the proposed parses) on a bhnd test set of sentences.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The second task is statistical, with the goal of developing a model of the grammar which assigns maximum probability for the correct parse. We give parsing results on text from computer manuals.</Paragraph>
