ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reports recent efforts to apply the speaker-independent SPHINX-H system to the DARPA Wall Street Journal continuous speech recognition task. In SPHINX-H, we incorporated additional dynamic and speaker-normalized features, replaced discrete models with sex-dependent semi-continuous hidden Markov models, augmented within-word triphones with between-word triphones, and extended generalized triphone models to shared-distribution models. The configuration of SPHINX-II being used for this task includes sex-dependent, semi-continuous, shared-distribution hidden Markov models and left context dependent between-word triphones. In applying our technology to this task we addressed issues that were not previously of concern owing to the (relatively) small size of the Resource Management task. 1</Paragraph>
