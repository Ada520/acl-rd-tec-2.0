Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The main problem arising from the use of complex constraints in Computational Linguists is due to the NP-hardness of checking whether a given set of constraints is satisfiable and, in the affirmative case, of generating the set of minimal models which satisfy the constraints. In this &amp;quot;paper we show how the CLG approach to rewriting constraints while constructing a partial model can greatly reduce the size of the original constraints and thus contribute to reduce the computational problem.</Paragraph>
