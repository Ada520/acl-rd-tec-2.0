</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A high-level language lor the description of inflectional morphology is presented, in which the organization of word lormation rules into an ii~herilance hierarchy of paradigms allows lora natural encoding of the kinds of nfles typically pre~uted in grammar txroks. We show how tim language, composed of orthographic rides, word formation rules, and paradigm inheritance, can be compiled into a run-time data structure for efficient morphological analysis and generation with a dynamic secondary storage lexicon.</Paragraph>
