Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a generation method for feature-structured)ased unification grammars.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> As comlx~red with fixed ~rity term notation, feature structure notation is more tlexible for representing knowledge needed to generate idiom~ttic structures as well as genem~l constructions. The method enables feature strncture retrieval via nmltiple indices. The indexing mechanism, when used with a semantic head driven generation algorithm, attains efficient generation even when a large amount of generation knowledge must be considered. Our method can produce all possi ble structures in parNlet, using structure sharing among ambiguous substructures.</Paragraph>
