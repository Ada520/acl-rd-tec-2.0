ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe a method of extracting information from an on-line resource for the consmaction of lexical entries for a multi-lingual, interlingual MT system (ULTRA). We have been able to automatically generate lexical entries for interlingual concepts corresponding to nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Although several features of these entries continue to be supplied manually we have greatly decreased the time required to generate each entry and see this as a promising method for the creation of large-scale lexicons.</Paragraph>
