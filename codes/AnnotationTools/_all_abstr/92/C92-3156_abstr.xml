ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The TANKA project seeks to build a model of a technical domain by semi-automatically processing unedited English text that describes this domain. Each sentence is parsed and conceptual elements are extracted from the parse. Concepts are derived from the Case structure of a sentence, and added to a conceptual network that represents knowledge about the domain. The DIPETr parser has a particularly broad coverage of English syntax; its newest version can also process sentence fragments. The HAIKU subsystem is responsible for user-assisted semantic interpretation. It contains a Case Analyzer module that extracts phrases marking concepts from the parse and uses its past processing experience to derive the most likely Case realizations of each with almost no a priori semantic knowledge. The user must validate these selections. A key issue in our research is minimizing the number of interactions with the user by intelligently generating the alternatives offered.</Paragraph>
