ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper discusses complex structural changes during transfer within a non-destructive transfer framework.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Though the description of each individual structural change is not difficult, special provision must be made when they are combined, because interaction between them sometimes causes unexpected problems. Transfer of coordinate structures is also discussed as this often necessitates a structural change and interacts with other structural changes in a problematic way.</Paragraph>
