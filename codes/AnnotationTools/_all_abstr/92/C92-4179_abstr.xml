Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> No one has come up with a eompletely satisfactory set of deep ca.ses relations (or thematir rehu.ions). The underlying reason is that any finite set of case re lations C&amp;ll capture only some of the gellera\]izatkms desired, l prol)ose taste;u\] a feature Sl)aCC/ rel)resen tation of relational inh)rmation, where tim axes are such things as degree of responsibility, degree of nc tivity, and degree of alreetxuhless The role of a par ticipant in au ewmt (:all then be described as a pOiltl in tiffs space, allowing more accurate representation of relational information. The don,ahL of validity of each relevant linguist~ic generalizations corresponds to a prototype-centered region in the space. This pro posal is easy to implement.</Paragraph>
