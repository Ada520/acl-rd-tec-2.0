ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This note describes the current development of an approach to parsing designed to overcome some of the problems of existing parsers, particularly with respect to their utility a~ language models. The parser combines lexical and grammatical constraints into a uniform grammatical representation, is readily trainable (since the parser output is indistinguishable from the grammar input), and uses analogy to guess about the likelihood of constructions outside the grammar.</Paragraph>
