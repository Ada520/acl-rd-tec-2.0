ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We show how the two main characteristics of the ILLICO natural language interface -guided composition mode by partial synthesis, and the modularity of the encoding of li,aguistic knowledge specifying the lexical, syntactic, semantic and conceptual levels of well-formedness -- have lead us to develop an approach and a system in which all the constraints on the different levels of well-formedness are coroutined when the system analyzes a given sentence or synthesizes a partial one. We describe the principle of the general coroutining process and the associated Prolog program.</Paragraph>
