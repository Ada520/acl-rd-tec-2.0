ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe work which uses decision trees to estimate marginal probabilities in a maximum entropy model for predicting the part-of-speech of a word given the context in which it appears. Two experiments are presented which exhibit improvements over the usual hidden Markov model approach. null</Paragraph>
