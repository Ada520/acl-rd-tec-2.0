Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe the lexical knowledge base system (LKB) which has been designed and implemented as part of the ACQUILEX project 1 to allow the representation of multilinguM syntactic and semantic information extracted from machine readable dictionaries (MRDs), in such a way that it is usable by natural language processing (NLP) systems. The LKB's lexical representation language (LRL) augments typed graph-based unification with default inheritance, formalised in terms of default unification of feature structures. We evaluate how well the LRL meets the practical requirements arising from the semi-automatic construction of a large scale, multilingual lexicon. The system as described is fully implemented and is being used to represent substantial amounts of information automatically extracted from MRDs.</Paragraph>
