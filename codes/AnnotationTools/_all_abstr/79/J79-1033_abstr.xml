<Paragraph position="0"> The papers comprising this microfiche (the second of five) present in expanded form (as submitted by their authors) the six talks given in Session 2: Language Generation Systems. Various aspects of generation are considered, among them: relationsHips between parsing and generation (Knaus), planning modules and data structures basic to story development (Meehan) , semantic networks and linguistic generatorq (Shapiro and Slocum), message structures and translation strategies (McDonald) , and lexical processes in compound noun formation (Rhyne). Thanks to Martin Kay for chairing this session.</Paragraph>
