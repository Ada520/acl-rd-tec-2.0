<Paragraph position="1"> The paper also indicates what additional requirements are needed for a full treatment of pronominal anphora. These include use of a representation such as that of Webber \[197g\]; linguistic rules such as the disjoint reference rules of Lasnik \[\[976\] and Reinhart \[\[976\] as well as rules of anapbora in logical form given by Cbomsky \[1976\]; and presence of actor loci such as they in D3. The nature of these requirements is discussed, while the computational inclusion of them is found in $idner \[ 1979\].</Paragraph>
