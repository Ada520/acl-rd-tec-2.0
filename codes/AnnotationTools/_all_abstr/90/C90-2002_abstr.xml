Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe a program of research designed to explore.' how a lexical semantic theory may be exploited for extracting information from corpora suitable for use in Information Retrieval applications. Unlike with purely statistical collocational analyses, the framework of a semantic theory allows the ~ultomatic construction of predictions about semantic relationships among words appearing in coltocatioz~al systems. We illustrate the at)proach for the acquisition of lexical information for several classes of nominals.</Paragraph>
