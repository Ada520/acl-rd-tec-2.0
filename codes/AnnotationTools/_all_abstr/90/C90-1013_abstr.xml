Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This article introduces a bidirectional grammar generation system called feature structure-directed generation, developed for a dialogue translation system. The system utilizes typed feature structures to control the top-down derivation in a declarative way. This generation system also uses disjunctive feature structures to reduce the number of copies of the derivation tree. The grammar for this generator is designed to properly generate the speaker's intention in a telephone dialogue.</Paragraph>
