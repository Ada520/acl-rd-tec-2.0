1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes C-PATR, a new C implementation of the PATR-II formalism \[4, 5\] for unification-based grammars. It includes innovations that originate with a project for developing an efficient translator from English to first-order logic \[2\], most notably the extension of the standard unifcation algorithm for list values \[section 3\]. In addition the unifier and a chart parser tuned for categorial grammars, the system (C-PATR) contains a set of tools necessary for grammar development. These tools include facilities for hier,~rehical lexicon design and interactive grammar debugging \[section 4\].</Paragraph>
