Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> SRI and U.C. Berkeley have begun a cooperative effort to develop a new architecture for real-time implementation of spoken language systems (SLS). Our goal is to develop fast speech recognition algorithms, and supporting hardware capable of recognizing continuous speech from a bigram- or trigram-based 20,000-word vocabulary or a 1,000- to 5,000word SLS.</Paragraph>
