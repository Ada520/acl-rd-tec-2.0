<Paragraph position="0"> &amp;quot;Ille method has been implemented as a Como mon Lisp program on a pVAX-II. A core GPSG grannnar of French was developed using this parser.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In order to assess the interest of the bidirectional chart and its head-driven bottom-up strategy we made a series of tests consisting in parsing a small set of French sentences under three different strategies : strategy I was left-to-right and top-down, strategy 1I was left-to-right and bottom-up, and strategy Iii, the chosen one, is bidirectional, bottom-up ,and head-driven. Table 1 gives the observed performances of the three strategies measured by the total number of edges created and the total CPU time needed to parse all sentences t.</Paragraph>
