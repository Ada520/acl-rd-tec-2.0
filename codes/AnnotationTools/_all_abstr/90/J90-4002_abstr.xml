SENTENTIAL SEMANTICS FOR PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The sentential theory of propositional attitudes is very attractive to AI workers, but it is difficult to use such a theory to assign semantics to English sentences about attitudes. The problem is that a compositional semantics cannot easily build the logical forms that the theory requires. We present a new notation for a sentential theory, and a unification grammar that builds logical forms in our notation. The grammar is implemented using the standard implementation of definite clause grammars in Prolog.</Paragraph>
