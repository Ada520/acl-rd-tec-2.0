Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a system which analyzes an in'put text syntactically and morphologically and converts the text from the graphemic to the phonetic :representation (or vice versa). We describe the grammar formaSsm used and report a parsing experiment which compared eight parsing strategies within the :h'amework of chart parsing. Although the morphological and syntactic analyzer has been developed for a text-to-speech system for German, it is language independent and general enough to be used for dialog systems, NL-interfaces or speech recognition systems. null</Paragraph>
