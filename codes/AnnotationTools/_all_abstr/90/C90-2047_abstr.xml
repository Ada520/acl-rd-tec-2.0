Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, I give an account, in terms of centering theory \[GJW86\], of some phenomena of pronominalization in Italian, in particular the use of the null or the overt pronoun in subject position. After a general introduction to the Italian pronominal system, I will review centering, and then show how the original rules given in \[GJW86\] have to be extended or modified.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Finally, I will show that centering does not account for two phenomena: first, the functional role of an utterance may override the predictions of centering; second, a null subject can be used to refer to a whole discourse segment. This latter phenomenon should ideally be explained in the same terms that the other phenomena involving null subject are.</Paragraph>
