<Paragraph position="0"> * The signal processing will be improved by systematically evaluating the performance of a wide variety of signal processing algorithms.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> * The robusmess will be improved by modeling altemate word pronunciations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> * The performance on short function words will be improved by developing techniques specifically modeling the phenomena which occur for such words. * The performance will be improved in general by detailed post-analysis of specific errors.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> * The overall error rate will be reduced by a factor of two compared to the current system.</Paragraph>
