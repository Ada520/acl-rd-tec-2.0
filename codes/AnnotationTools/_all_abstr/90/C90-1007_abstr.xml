Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> THALES is a software package for plane geometry constructions, supplied with a natural language interlace. Using THALES requires no knowledge of a programming language. The interface is capable of processing practically all kinds of instructions within the subset of plane geometry English. The &amp;quot;static semantic&amp;quot; module has been generated on the basis of a high-level attribute specification. Transportability, modifiability and generality -- the key issues of natural language interface design -- are investigated in the project note. The notion of specifiability is introduced to replace the three features mentioned above.</Paragraph>
