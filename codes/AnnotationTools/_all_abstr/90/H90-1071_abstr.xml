<Paragraph position="0"> This paper is concerned with the acquisition of the lexicon. In particular, we propose a method that uses analogical reasoning to hypothesize new polysemous word senses. This method is one of a number of knowledge acquisition devices to be included in DIRC (Domain Independent Retargetable Consultan0. DIRC is a kind of intelligent, natural language-capable consultant kit that can be retargeted at different domains. DIRC is essentially &amp;quot;empty-UC&amp;quot; (UNIX Consultant, Wilensky et al., 1988). DIRC is to include the language and reasoning mechanisms of UC, plus a large grammar and a general lexicon. The user must then add domain knowledge, user knowledge and lexical knowledge for the area of interest.</Paragraph>
