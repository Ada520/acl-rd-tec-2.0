<Paragraph position="0"> This paper is concerned with the acquisition of the lexicon. In particular, we propose a method that uses ann o lo~,ical reasoning to hypothesize new polysemous word se,ses. This method is one of a number of knowledge acquisition devices to be included in DIRC (Domain Independent Retargetable Consultant). DIRC is a kind ol intelligent, natm'al language-capable consultant kit that can be retargeted at different domains. DIRC is essentially &amp;quot;emptyoUC&amp;quot; (UNIX Consultant, Wilensky et al., 1988). DIRC is to include the language and reasoning mechanisms of UC, plus a large grammar and a ge, neral lexicon. The user must then add domain kr~owledge, user knowledge and lexieal kqlowledge for th,~ area of interest.</Paragraph>
