Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> There has been a long-standing methodology for evaluating work in speech recognition (SR), but until recently no community-wide methodology existed for either natural language (NL) researchers or speech understanding (SU) researchers for evaluating the systems they developed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of SLS systems, and that methodology is being used in practice for the first time.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> This paper gives an overview of the process that was followed in creating a meaningful evaluation mechanism, describes the current mechanism, and presents some directions for future development.</Paragraph>
