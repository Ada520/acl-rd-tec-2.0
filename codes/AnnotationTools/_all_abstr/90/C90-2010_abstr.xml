The other is the principles. Each feature structure can be viewed as a set of interpretable representations of syntactic and semantic information governed by a formal synt~. A parser or generator interpretes feature structures while parsing or generating sentences. The interpretation processes are guided by the principles of the grammar, qhe principles define well-formedness conditions and the rules for infommtion management for sentences and phrases.
