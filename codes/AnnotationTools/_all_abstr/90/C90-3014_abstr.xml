A Phonological
Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the framework of a Korean phonological knowledge base system using the unification-based grammar formalism : Korean Phonology Structure Grammar (KPSG). The approach of KPSG provides an explicit development model for constructing a computational phonological system : speech recognition and synthesis system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We show that the proposed approach is more describable than other approaches such as those employing a traditional generative phonological approach.</Paragraph>
