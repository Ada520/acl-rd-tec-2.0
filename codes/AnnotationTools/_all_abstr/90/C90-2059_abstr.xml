Severn 'exa~ffple's belOw will show that gapping is actually affected 'by' a, combination of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors, thus being far from a purely syntactic phenomenon. By looking at some basic properties of gapping from the point of view of interpretation and cognitive pro,cessing, it is possible to arrive at a global principle tha t can provide an integrated approach for these Various intluences on. gapping. The principle proposed has the added advantage of being ndt justian arbitrary formal rule but being motivated by eogni{ivh cOnsidei'ations. Thus, tile view taken here is compat!ble with tire basic tenets o\[ Cognitive' !,inguist,ics. '</Paragraph>
