Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper exarnines the properties of featureba~sed partial descriptions built on top of tlalliday's systemic networks. We show that the crucial operation of consistency checking for such descriptions is NP-complete, and therefore probably intractable, but proceed to develop algorithms which can sometimes alleviate the unpleasant consequence s of this intractability.</Paragraph>
