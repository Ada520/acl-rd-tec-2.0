</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we examine some issues pertaining to the task of selection in text planning. We attempt to distinguish salience and relevance, and characterize their role as important fundamental notions governing selection. We also formulate the problem of selection of text content in terms of the coupling between domain-level tasks and text planning tasks. We describe our research on generating bus route descriptions.</Paragraph>
