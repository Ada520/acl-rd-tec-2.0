ANALYSIS
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The lexical .entries for German syntactic analysis are taken from the analysis dictionary which is combined with a system of inflection lists; an analysis of inflectional endings is embedded in the dictionary access. A word form entry contains word class information, morphological features and values, some semantic information and the name of the lexeme.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> While the system is running, the lists of information and features are converted</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> into numbers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> For syntactic parsing an ATN-grammar is used to recognize nominal and prepositio ~ nal phrases, adverbials and verbs or verbal groups. A special embedded program analyzes the verb constituents. Homonymous morphological and word class features are disambiguated as far as possible throughout the parsing process.</Paragraph>
