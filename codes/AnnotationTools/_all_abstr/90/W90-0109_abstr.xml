Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, I define the notion of an abstract linguistic resource which reifies as a term for use by the text planner just those combinations of concrete linguistic resources (the words, morphological markings, syntactic structures, etc. that actually appear in a stream of text) that are expressible. I present a representational level, the Text Structure, which is defined in these abstract linguistic terms and which mediates and constrains the commitments of a text planner to ensure that the utterance being planned will be expressible in language.</Paragraph>
