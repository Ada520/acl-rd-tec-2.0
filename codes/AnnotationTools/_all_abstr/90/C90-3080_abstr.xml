<Paragraph position="1"> The fbnnalism has been extended to include the constraints of LFG as well as negation and disjunction, which are implemented with the disjunction and negation-as-failure of PROLOG itself. A technique of constraint threading is employed to collect negative and constraining conditions in PROLOG difference lists. The parser of QPATR uses a left-corner algorithm for context-free grammars and includes a facility for identifying new lexical items in input on the basis of contextual information.</Paragraph>
