Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> fin this paper, we describe a working system for interactive Japanese syntactic an',dysis. A human user can intervene during parsing to hell) the system to produce a correct parse tree. Human interactions are limited to the very simple task of indicating the modifiee (governor) of a phrase, and thus a non-expert native speaker can use the syst:em. The user is free to give any information in ;my order, or even to provide no information. The :.;ystem is being used as the source language analyzer of a Japanese-to-English machine translation ::;ystem currently under development.</Paragraph>
