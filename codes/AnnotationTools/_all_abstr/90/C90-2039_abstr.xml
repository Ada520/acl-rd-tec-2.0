<Paragraph position="0"> The strategic lazy incremental copy graph unification method is a combination of two methods for unifying hmture structures. One, called the lazy incremental copy graph unification method, achieves structure sharing with constant order data access time which reduces the cequired memory. The other, called ti~e strategic incremental copy graph unification method, uses an early failure finding strategy which first tries to unify :;ubstructures tending to fail in unification; this method is; based on stochastic data on tim likelihood of failure and ,'educes unnecessary computation. The combined method .makes each feature structure unification efficient and also reduces garbage collection and page swapping occurrences, thus increasing the total efficiency of natural language processing systems mainly based on I.yped feature structure unification such as natural language analysis and generation sysl~ems.</Paragraph>
