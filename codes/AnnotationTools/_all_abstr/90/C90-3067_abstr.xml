<Paragraph position="0"> A lot of work has been done in the field of natural language processing (NLP) for ARABIC. Few researchers have tried hard to apply on ARABIC the methods of computational linguistics, as for example, Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) \[I\] and Augmented Transition Networks (ATN) \[2\]. Because there is not a modern linguistic model for ARABIC grammar within the frame of computational linguistics, the results achieved are not comparable with that achieved on ENGLISH.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In this paper, we represent the phrase structures covering ARABIC.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> They are completely different from ENGLISH.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> i. INTRODUCTION Since ARABIC is a rich and highly inflected language \[3\], there are grannnatical categories in ARABIC which do not exist in other foreign languages such as in ENGLISH \[4\].

Moreover, there are syntactic categories in ARABIC which could themselves be a whole sentence or even a psepositional phrase An example of such a category is the adverb . In addition, there are other differences in the order of the constituents within the sentence. For example, in ARABIC, adjectives follow the noun which they modify.</Paragraph>
