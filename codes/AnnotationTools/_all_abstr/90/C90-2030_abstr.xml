Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The possibility of multiple equivalent proofs presents a problem for efficient parsing of a number of flexible categorial grammar (CG) frameworks. In this paper I outline a normal form system for a sequent formulation of the product-free associative Lambek Calculus. This le,'~ls to a simple parsing approach that yields only normal form proofs. This approach is both ~afe in that all distinct readings for a sentence will be returned, and optimal in ~;hat there is only one normal form proof yielding each distinct meaning.</Paragraph>
