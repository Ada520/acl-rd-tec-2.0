ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> An algorithm for the morphological decomposition of words into morphemes is presented. The application area is information retrieval, and the purpose is to find morphologically related terms to a given search term. First, the parsing framework is presented, then several linguistic decisions are discussed: morpheme selection and segmentation, morpheme classes, morpheme grammar, allomorph handling, etc. Since the system works in several languages, language-specific phenomena are mentioned.</Paragraph>
