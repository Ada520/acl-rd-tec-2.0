</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Tills paper describes a computational method for correcting users' miseonceptioas concerning the objects modelled by a compute,&amp;quot; s.ystem. The method involves classifying object-related misc,mce|,tions according to the knowledge-base feature involved in the incorrect information. For each resulting class sub-types are identified, :.:cording to the structure of the knowledge base, which indicate wh:LI i.formativn may be supporting the misconception and therefore what information to include in the response. Such a characteriza*i,,n, along with a model of what the user knows, enables the syst.cm to reas,m in a domain-independent way about how best to c~rrv,'t \[he user.</Paragraph>
