ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes some recent developments in language processing involving computational models which more closely resemble the brain in both structure and function. These models employ a large number of interconnected parallel computational units which communicate via weighted levels of excitation and inhibition. A specific model is described which uses this approach to process some fragments of connected discourse.</Paragraph>
