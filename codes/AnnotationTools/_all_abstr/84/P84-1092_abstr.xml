ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Computational neurolinguistics (CN) is an approach to computational linguistics which includes neurally-motivated constraints in the design of models of natural language processing.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Furthermore, the knowledge representations included in such models must be supported with documented behaviorial ev~ce, normal and pathological. null This paper will discuss the contribution of CN models to ~the understanding of linguistic &amp;quot;competence&amp;quot; within recent research efforts to adapt HOPE (Gigley 1981; 1982a; 1982b; 1982c; 1983a), an implemented CN model for &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; English to I'ESPERANCE, one which &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot; French.</Paragraph>
