</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> While both theoretical and empirical studies of question-answering have revealed the inadequacy of traditional definitions of Ve*-no questions (YNQs), little progress has been made toward a more satisfactory redefinition. This paper reviews the limitations of several proposed revisions. It proposes a new definition of YNQs baaed upon research on a type of conversational irnpIieature, termed here setdar imp/ie,,ture, that helps define appropriate responses to YNQs.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> By representing YNQs as sealer qtteriee it is possible to support a wider variety of system anti user responses in a principled way.</Paragraph>
