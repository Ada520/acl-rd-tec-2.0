Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we argue that natural language interfaces to databases should be able to produce summary responses as well as listing actual data. We describe a system (incorporating a number of heuristics and a knowledge base built on top of the database) that has been developed to generate such summary responses. It is largely domain-independent, has been tested on many examples, and handles a wide variety of situations where summary responses would be useful.</Paragraph>
