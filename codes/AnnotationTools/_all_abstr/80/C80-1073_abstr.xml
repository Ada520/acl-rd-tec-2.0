ATNS USED AS A PROCEDURAL DIALOG MODEL
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> D. Metzing, University of Bielefeld, Germany Summary An attempt has been made to use an Augmented Transition Network IO as a 'procedural dialog model'. The development of such a model appears to be important in several respects: - as a device to represent and to use different dialog schemata proposed in empirical conversation analysis; - as a device to represent and to use models of verbal interaction; - as a device combining knowledge about dialog schemata and about verbal interaction with knowledge about task-oriented and goal-directed dialogs. A standard ATN should be further developed in order to account for the verbal interactions of task-oriented dialogs.</Paragraph>
