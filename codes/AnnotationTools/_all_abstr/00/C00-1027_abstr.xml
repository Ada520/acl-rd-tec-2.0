Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Repetition is very common. Adaptive language models, which allow probabilities to change or adapt after seeing just a few words of a text, were introduced in speech recognition to account for text cohesion.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Suppose a document mentions Noriega once. What is the chance that he will be mentioned again? if the first instance has probability p, then under standard (bag-of words) independence assumptions, two instances ought to have probability p2, but we find the probability is actually closer to p/2. The first mention of a word obviously depends on frequency, but surprisingly, the second does not. Adaptation depends more on lexical content than fl'equency; there is more adaptation for content words (proper nouns, technical terminology and good keywords for information retrieval), and less adaptation for function words, cliches and ordinary first names.</Paragraph>
