Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Because of their constant renewal, it is necessary to acquire fresh named entities (NEs) from recent text sources. We present a tool for the acquisition and the typing of NEs from the Web that associates a harvester and three parallel shallow parsers dedicated to specific structures (lists, enumerations, and anchors).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The parsers combine lexical indices such as discourse markers with formatting instructions (HTML tags) for analyzing enumerations and associated initializers.</Paragraph>
