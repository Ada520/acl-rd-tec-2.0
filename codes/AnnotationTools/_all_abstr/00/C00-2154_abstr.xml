<Paragraph position="0"> We have implenlented a.n interactive, Wel)-based, chat-style machine translation system, SUpl)ort;ing speech recognition and synthesis, local- or third-party correction of speech recognition and machine tra.nslation output, a.nd online learning. The underlying client-server architecture, implemented in .la.va TM, pl:ovides remote, distributed computation for the translation and speech sut)systems. We further describe our Web-based user interthces, whMi can easily produce different uscflfl eonfigllrartions.</Paragraph>
