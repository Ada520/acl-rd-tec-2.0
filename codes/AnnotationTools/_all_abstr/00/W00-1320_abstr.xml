Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a first attempt at a statistical model for simultaneous syntactic parsing and generalized word-sense disambignation. On a new data set we have constructed for the task, while we were disappointed not to find parsing improvement over a traditional parsing model, our model achieves a recall of 84.0% and a precision of 67.3% of exact synset matches on our test corpus, where the gold standard has a reported inter-annotator agreement of 78.6%.</Paragraph>
