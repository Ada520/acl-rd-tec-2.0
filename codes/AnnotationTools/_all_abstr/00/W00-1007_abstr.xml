Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper 1 I describe the use of Danish pronouns and deictics in dialogues. Then I present an adaptation to Danish of Eckert and Strube's algorithm for resolving anaphora referring to individual NPs and abstract objects in English dialogues (Eckert and Strube, 1999b; Eckert and Strube, 1999a).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The adapted algorithm is tested on four Danish dialogues from two dialogue collections and the results obtained are evaluated.</Paragraph>
