</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In Japanese, case structure analysis is very imt)ortant to handle several troublesome characteristics of Japanese snch as scrambling, onfission of ease components, mid disappearance of case markers. However, fi)r lack of a wide-coverage ease frame dictionary, it has been difficult to perfornl case structure analysis accurat;ely. Although several methods to construct a ease fl'mne dictionary from analyzed corpora have been proposed, they cannot avoid data sparseness 1)rol)lem. This paper proposes an unsupervised method of constructing a case frame dictionary from an enormous raw corpus by using a robust and accurate parser. It also prorides a case structure analysis method based on the constructed dictionary.</Paragraph>
