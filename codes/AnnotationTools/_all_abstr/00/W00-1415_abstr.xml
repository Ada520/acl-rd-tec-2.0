Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> It is not a rare phenomenon for human written text to use non-restrictive NP modifiers to express essential pieces of information or support the situation presented in the main proposition containing the NP, for example, &amp;quot;Private Eye, which couldn't afford the libel payment, had been threatened with closure.&amp;quot; (from Wall Street Journal) Yet no previous research in NLG investigates this in detail. This paper describes corpus analysis and a psycholinguistic experiment regarding the acceptability of using non-restrictive NP modifiers to express semantic relations that might normally be signalled by 'because' and 'then'. The experiment tests several relevant factors and enables us to accept or reject a number of hypotheses. The results are incorporated into an NLG system based on a Genetic Algorithm.</Paragraph>
