Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe in this paper a boolean Information l~.etrieval system that adds word semantics to the classic word based indexing. Two of the main tasks of our system, namely the indexing and retrieval components, are using a combined word-based and sense-based approach.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The key to our system is a methodology for building semantic representations of open text, at word and collocation level. This new technique, called semantic indexing, shows improved effectiveness over the classic word based indexing techniques.</Paragraph>
