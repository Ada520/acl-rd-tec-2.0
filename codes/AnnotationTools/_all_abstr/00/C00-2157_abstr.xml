Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces a description language for syntactically annotated corpora which allows for encoding both the syntactic annotation to a corpus and the queries to a syntactically annotated corpus.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In terms of descriptive adequacy and computational efficiency, the description language is a compromise between script-like corpus query languages and high-level, typed unification-based grammar formalisms.</Paragraph>
