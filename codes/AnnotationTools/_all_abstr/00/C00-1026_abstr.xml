Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Tim paper describes a similarity-based model to present the morphological rules for Chinese compound nouns. This representation model serves functions of 1) as the morphological rules of the compounds, 2) as a mean to evaluate the properness of a compound construction, and 3) as a mean to disambiguate the semantic ambiguity of the nlorphological head of a compound noun. An automatic semantic classil'ication system for Chinese unknown compounds is thus implemented based on the model. Experiments and on'or analyses arc also presented.</Paragraph>
