Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Sophisticated grammar formalisms, such as LFG, allow concisely capturing complex linguistic phenomena. The powerful operators provided by such formalisms can however introduce spurious ambiguity, making parsing inefficient. A simple form of corpus-based grammar pruning is evaluated experimentally on two wide-coverage grammars, one Engiish and one French. Speedups of up to a factor 6 were obtained, at a cost in grammatical coverage of about 13%. A two-stage architecture allows achieving significant speedups without introducing additional parse failures.</Paragraph>
