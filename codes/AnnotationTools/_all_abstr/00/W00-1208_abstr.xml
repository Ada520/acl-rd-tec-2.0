Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we present a method for comparing Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars extracted from annotated corpora for three languages: English, Chinese and Korean. This method makes it possible to do a quantitative comparison between the syntactic structures of each language, thereby providing a way of testing the Universal Grammar Hypothesis, the foundation of modern linguistic theories.</Paragraph>
