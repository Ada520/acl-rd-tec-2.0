<Paragraph position="0"> Designing the dialogue strategy of a spoken dialogue system involves many nontrivial choices. This paper I)resents a reinforcement learning approach for automatically optimizing a dialogue strategy that addresses the technical challenges in applying reinforcement learning to a working dialogue system with hulnan users. \Y=e then show that our approach measurably improves performance in an experimental system.</Paragraph>
