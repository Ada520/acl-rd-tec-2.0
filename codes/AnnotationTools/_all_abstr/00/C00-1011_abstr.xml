Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Common wisdom has it that tile bias of stochastic grammars in favor of shorter deriwttions of a sentence is hamfful and should be redressed. We show that the common wisdom is wrong for stochastic grammars that use elementary trees instead o1' conlext-l'ree rules, such as Stochastic Tree-Substitution Grammars used by Data-Oriented Parsing models. For such grammars a non-probabilistic metric based on tile shortest derivation outperforms a probabilistic metric on the ATIS and OVIS corpora, while it obtains competitive results on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. This paper also contains the first publislmd experiments with DOP on the WSJ.</Paragraph>
