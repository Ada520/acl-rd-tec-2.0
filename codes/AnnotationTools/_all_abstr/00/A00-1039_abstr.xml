Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Information Extraction (IE) systems are commonly based on pattern matching. Adapting an IE system to a new scenario entails the construction of a new pattern base---a time-consuming and expensive process. We have implemented a system for finding patterns automatically from un-annotated text. Starting with a small initial set of seed patterns proposed by the user, the system applies an incremental discovery procedure to identify new patterns.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We present experiments with evaluations which show that the resulting patterns exhibit high precision and recall.</Paragraph>
