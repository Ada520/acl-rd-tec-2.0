Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A method is de.scribed by which a rhetoricalstructure tree can be realized by a text structure made up of sections, paragraphs, sentences, vertical lists, mid other textual patterns, with discourse connectives added (in the correct positions) to mark rhetorical relations. We show that text-structuring can be formulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, so that all solutions rest)ecting constraints on text-structure formation and structu,'al compatibility can be efficiently generated. Of the many sohltions generated by this method, some are stylistically preferable to others; we show how further constraints can be applied in order to select the best versions. Finally, we discuss some extensions such as the generation of indented text structures.</Paragraph>
