Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A finite-state method, based on leftmost longest-match replacement, is presented for segmenting words into graphemes, and for converting graphemes into phonemes. A small set of hand-crafted conversion rules for Dutch achieves a phoneme accuracy of over 93%. The accuracy of the system is further improved by using transformation-based learning. The phoneme accuracy of the best system (using a large rule and a 'lazy' variant of Brill's algoritm), trained on only 40K words, reaches 99%.</Paragraph>
