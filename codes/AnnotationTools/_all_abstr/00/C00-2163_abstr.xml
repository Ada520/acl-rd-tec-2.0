<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we t)resent and compare various alignnmnt models for statistical machine translation. We propose to measure tile quality of an aligmnent model using the quality of the Viterbi alignment comt)ared to a manually-produced alignment and describe a refined mmotation scheme to produce suitable reference alignments. We also con,pare the impact of different; alignment models on tile translation quality of a statistical machine translation system.</Paragraph>
