<Paragraph position="0"> Experimental studies of interactive language use have shed light on the cognitive and interpersonal processes that shape conversation; corpora are the emergent products of these processes. I will survey studies that focus on under-modelled aspects of interactive language use, including the processing of spontaneous speech and disfluencies; metalinguistic displays such as hedges; interactive processes that affect choices of referring expressions; and how communication media shape conversations. The findings suggest some agendas for computational linguistics.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Introduction Language is shaped not only by grammar, but also by the cognitive processing of speakers and addressees, and by the medium in which it is used. These forces have, until recently, received little attention, having been originally consigned to &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot; by Chomsky, and considered to be of secondary importance by many others. But as anyone who has listened to a tape of herself lecturing surely knows, spoken language is formally quite different from written language. And as those who have transcribed conversation are excruciatingly aware, interactive, spontaneous speech is especially messy and disfluent. This fact is rarely acknowledged by psychological theories of comprehension and production (although see Brennan &amp; Schober, in press; Clark, 1994, 1997; Fox Tree, 1995). In fact, experimental psycholinguists still make up most of their materials, so that much of what we know about sentence processing is based on a sanitized, ideal form of language that no one actually speaks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> But the field of computational linguistics has taken an interesting turn: Linguists and computational linguists who formerly used made-up sentences are now using naturally- and experimentally-generated corpora on which to base and test their theories. One of the most exciting developments since the early 1990s has been the focus on corpus data.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> Organized efforts such as LDC and ELRA have assembled large and varied corpora of speech and text, making them widely available to researchers and creators of natural language and speech recognition systems. Finally, Internet usage has generated huge corpora of interactive spontaneous text or &amp;quot;visible conversations&amp;quot; that little resemble edited texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Of course, ethnographers and sociolinguists who practice conversation analysis (e.g., Sacks, Schegloff, &amp; Jefferson, 1974; Goodwin, 1981) have known for a long time that spontaneous interaction is interesting in its own right, and that although conversation seems messy at first glance, it is actually orderly. Conversation analysts have demonstrated that speakers coordinate with each other such feats as achieving a joint focus of attention, producing closely timed turn exchanges, and finishing each another's utterances. These demonstrations have been compelling enough to inspire researchers from psychology, linguistics, computer science, and human-computer interaction to turn their attention to naturalistic language data.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> But it is important to keep in mind that a corpus is, after all, only an artifact--a product that emerges from the processes that occur between and within speakers and addressees.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> Researchers who analyze the textual records of conversation are only overhearers, and there is ample evidence that overhearers experience a conversation quite differently from addressees and from side participants (Schober &amp; Clark, 1989; Wilkes-Gibbs &amp; Clark, 1992). With a corpus alone, there is no independent evidence of what people actually intend or understand at different points in a conversation, or why they make the choices they do. Conversation experiments that provide partners with a task to do have much to offer, such as independent measures of communicative success as well as evidence of precisely when one partner is confused or has reached a hypothesis about the other's beliefs or intentions. Task-oriented corpora in combination with information about how they were generated are important for discourse studies.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="7"> We still don't know nearly enough about the cognitive and interpersonal processes that underlie spontaneous language use--how speaking and listening are coordinated between individuals as well as within the mind of someone who is switching speaking and listening roles in rapid succession. Hence, determining what information needs to be represented moment by moment in a dialog model, as well as how and when it should be updated and used, is still an open frontier. In this paper I start with an example and identify some distinctive features of spoken language interchanges. Then I describe several experiments aimed at understanding the processes that generate them. I conclude by proposing some desiderata for a dialog model.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="8"> Two people in search of a perspective To begin, consider the following conversational interchange from a laboratory experiment on referential communication. A director and a matcher who could not see each another were trying to get identical sets of picture cards lined up in the same order.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="9"> (1) D:ah boy this one ah boy all right it looks kinda likeon the right top there's a square that looks diagonal M: uh huh D: and you have sort of another like rectangle shape, thelike a triangle, angled, and on the bottom it's uh I don't know what that is, glass shaped M: all right I think I got it D: it's almost like a person kind of in a weird way M: yeah like like a monk praying or something D: right yeah good great M: all right I got it (Stellmann &amp; Brennan, 1993) Several things are apparent from this exchange. First, it contains several disfluencies or interruptions in fluent speech. The director restarts her first turn twice and her second turn once. She delivers a description in a series of installments, with backchannels from the matcher to confirm them. She seasons her speech with fillers like uh, pauses occasionally, and displays her commitment (or lack thereof) to what she is saying with displays like ah boy this one ah boy and I don't know what that is. Even though she is the one who knows what the target picture is, it is the matcher who ends up proposing the description that they both end up ratifying: like a monk praying or something.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="10"> Once the director has ratified this proposal, they have succeeded in establishing a conceptual pact (see Brennan &amp; Clark, 1996). En route, both partners hedged their descriptions liberally, marking them as provisional, pending evidence of acceptance from the other. This example is typical; in fact, 24 pairs of partners who discussed this object ended up synthesizing nearly 24 different but mutually agreed-upon perspectives. Finally, the disfluencies, hedges, and turns would have been distributed quite differently if this conversation had been conducted over a different medium--through instant messaging, or if the partners had had visual contact. Next I will consider the proceses that underlie these aspects of interactive spoken communication.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="11"> 1 Speech is disfluent, and disfluencies bear information The implicit assumptions of psychological and computational theories that ignore disfluencies must be either that people aren't disfluent, or that disfluencies make processing more difficult, and so theories of fluent speech processing should be developed before the research agenda turns to disfluent speech processing. The first assumption is clearly false; disfluency rates in spontaneous speech are estimated by Fox Tree (1995) and by Bortfeld, Leon, Bloom, Schober, and Brennan (2000) to be about 6 disfluencies per 100 words, not including silent pauses. The rate is lower for speech to machines (Oviatt, 1995; Shriberg, 1996), due in part to utterance length; that is, disfluency rates are higher in longer utterances, where planning is more difficult, and utterances addressed to machines tend to be shorter than those addressed to people, often because dialogue interfaces are designed to take on more initiative. The average speaker may believe, quite rightly, that machines are imperfect speech processors, and plan their utterances to machines more carefully. The good news is that speakers can adapt to machines; the bad news is that they do so by recruiting limited cognitive resources that could otherwise be focused on the task itself. As for the second assumption, if the goal is to eventually process unrestricted, natural human speech, then committing to an early and exclusive focus on processing fluent utterances is risky. In humans, speech production and speech processing are done incrementally, using contextual information from the earliest moments of processing (see, e.g., Tanenhaus et al. 1995). This sort of processing requires quite a different architecture and different mechanisms for ambiguity resolution than one that begins processing only at the end of a complete and well-formed utterance. Few approaches to parsing have tried to handle disfluent utterances (notable exceptions are Core &amp; Schubert, 1999; Hindle, 1983; Nakatani &amp; Hirschberg, 1994; Shriberg, Bear, &amp; Dowding, 1992).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="12"> The few psycholinguistic experiments that have examined human processing of disfluent speech also throw into question the assumption that disfluent speech is harder to process than fluent speech. Lickley and Bard (1996) found evidence that listeners may be relatively deaf to the words in a reparandum (the part that would need to be excised in order for the utterance to be fluent), and Shriberg and Lickley (1993) found that fillers such as um or uh may be produced with a distinctive intonation that helps listeners distinguish them from the rest of the utterance. Fox Tree (1995) found that while previous restarts in an utterance may slow a listener's monitoring for a particular word, repetitions don't seem to hurt, and some fillers, such as uh, seem to actually speed monitoring for a subsequent word.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="13"> What information exists in disfluencies, and how might speakers use it? Speech production processes can be broken into three phases: a message or semantic process, a formulation process in which a syntactic frame is chosen and words are filled in, and an articulation process (Bock, 1986; Bock &amp; Levelt, 1994; Levelt, 1989). Speakers monitor their speech both internally and externally; that is, they can make covert repairs at the point when an internal monitoring loop checks the output of the formulation phase before articulation begins, or overt repairs when a problem is discovered after the articulation phase via the speaker's external monitor--the point at which listeners also have access to the signal (Levelt, 1989). According to Nooteboom's (1980) Main Interruption Rule, speakers tend to halt speaking as soon as they detect a problem. Production data from Levelt's (1983) corpus supported this rule; speakers interrupted themselves within or right after a problem word 69% of the time.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="14"> How are regularities in disfluencies exploited by listeners? We have looked at the comprehension of simple fluent and disfluent instructions in a constrained situation where the listener had the opportunity to develop expectations about what the speaker would say (Brennan &amp; Schober, in press). We tested two hypotheses drawn from some suggestions of Levelt's (1989): that &amp;quot;by interrupting a word, a speaker signals to the addressee that the word is an error,&amp;quot; and that an editing expression like er or uh may &amp;quot;warn the addressee that the current message is to be replaced,&amp;quot; as with Move to the ye-- uh, orange square. We collected naturally fluent and disfluent utterances by having a speaker watch a display of objects; when one was highlighted he issued a command about it, like &amp;quot;move to the yellow square.&amp;quot; Sometimes the highlight changed suddenly; this sometimes caused the speaker to produce disfluencies. We recorded enough tokens of simple disfluencies to compare the impact of three ways in which speakers interrupt themselves: immediately after a problem word, within a problem word, or within a problem word and with the filler uh.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="15"> We reasoned that if a disfluency indeed bears useful information, then we should be able to find a situation where a target word is faster to comprehend in a disfluent utterance than in a fluent one. Imagine a situation in which a listener expects a speaker to refer to one of two objects. If the speaker begins to name one and then stops and names the other, the way in which she interrupts the utterance might be an early clue as to her intentions. So the listener may be faster to recognize her intentions relative to a target word in a disfluent utterance than in an utterance in which disfluencies are absent.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="16"> We compared the following types of utterances:  a. Move to the orange square (naturally fluent) b. Move to the |orange square (disfluency excised) c. Move to the yellow- orange square d. Move to the ye- orange square e. Move to the ye- uh, orange square f. Move to the orange square g. Move to the ye- orange square h. Move to the uh, orange square  Utterances c, d, and e were spontaneous disfluencies, and f, g, and h were edited versions that replaced the removed material with pauses of equal length to control for timing. In utterances c--h, the reparandum began after the word the and continued until the interruption site (after the unintended color word, color word fragment, or location where this information had been edited out). The edit interval in c--h began with the interruption site, included silence or a filler, and ended with the onset of the repair color word. Response times were calculated relative to the onset of the repair, orange.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="17"> The results were that listeners made fewer errors, the less incorrect information they heard in the reparandum (that is, the shorter the reparandum), and they were faster to respond to the target word when the edit interval before the repair was longer. They comprehended target words after mid-word interruptions with fillers faster than they did after mid-word interruptions without fillers (since a filler makes the edit interval longer), and faster than they did when the disfluency was replaced by a pause of equal length. This filler advantage did not occur at the expense of accuracy--unlike with disfluent utterances without fillers, listeners made no more errors on disfluent utterances with fillers than they did on fluent utterances. These findings highlight the importance of timing in speech recognition and utterance interpretation. The form and length of the reparandum and edit interval bear consequences for how quickly a disfluent utterance is processed as well as for whether the listener makes a commitment to an interpretation the speaker does not intend.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="18"> Listeners respond to pauses and fillers on other levels as well, such as to make inferences about speakers' alignment to their utterances. People coordinate both the content and the process of conversation; fillers, pauses, and self-speech can serve as displays by speakers that provide an account to listeners for difficulties or delays in speaking (Clark, 1994; Clark, 1997; Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991). Speakers signal their Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK) when answering a question by the displays they put on right before the answer (or right before they respond with I don't know) (Brennan &amp; Williams, 1995; Smith &amp; Clark, 1993). In these experiments, longer latencies, especially ones that contained fillers, were associated with answers produced with a lower FOK and that turned out to be incorrect. Thus in the following example, A1 displayed a lower FOK than A2: Q: Who founded the American Red Cross? A1: .....um......... Florence Nightingale? A2: ......... Clara Barton.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="19"> Likewise, non-answers (e.g., I don't know) after a filler or a long latency were produced by speakers who were more likely to recognize the correct answers later on a multiple choice test; those who produced a non-answer immediately did not know the answers. Not only do speakers display their difficulties and metalinguistic knowledge using such devices, but listeners can process this information to produce an accurate Feeling-of-Another's-Knowing, or estimate of the speaker's likelihood of knowing the correct answer (Brennan &amp; Williams, 1995).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="20"> These programs of experiments hold implications for both the generation and interpretation of spoken utterances. A system could indicate its confidence in its message with silent pauses, fillers, and intonation, and users should be able to interpret this information accurately. If machine speech recognition were conducted in a fashion more like human speech recognition, timing would be a critical cue and incremental parses would be continually made and unmade. Although this approach would be computationally expensive, it might produce better results with spontaneous speech.</Paragraph>
