Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a grammar-based approach to semantic annotation which combines the notions of robust parsing and fuzzy grammars. We present an overview of a preliminary research aimed to generalize some results from a recent project on interaction through speech with information systems where techniques based on the above notions have been successfully applied. The goal of the article is to give a development environment to linguists*</Paragraph>
