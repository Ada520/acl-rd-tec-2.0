Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Most studies on discourse markers implicitly assume that only one marker or discourse relation will occur in a sentence. In reality, more than one relation may hold between text spans and may be cued by multiple discourse markers. We describe here a method for hierarchically organising discourse markers. The hierarchies are intended for use by a generation system to enable the selection and placement of more than one marker in a single text span.</Paragraph>
