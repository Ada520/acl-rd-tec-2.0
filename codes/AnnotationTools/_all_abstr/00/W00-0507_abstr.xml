Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the embedding of a statistical translation system within a text editor to produce TRANSTYPE, a system that watches over the user as he or she types a translation and repeatedly suggests completions for the text already entered. This innovative Embedded Machine Translation system is thus a specialized means of helping produce high quality translations. null</Paragraph>
