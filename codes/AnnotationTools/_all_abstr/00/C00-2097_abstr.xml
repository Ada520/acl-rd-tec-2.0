Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Systems now exist which are able to con:pile unification gralmnars into language models that can be included in a speech recognizer, but it is so far unclear whether non-trivial linguistically principled gralnlnars can be used for this purpose. We describe a series of experiments which investigate the question empirica.lly, by incrementally constructing a grammar and discovering what prot)lems emerge when successively larger versions are compiled into finite state graph representations and used as language models for a medium-vocabulary recognition task.</Paragraph>
