</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a hybrid approach to spontaneous speech parsing. The implelnented parser uses an extended probabilistic LR parsing model with rich context and its output is post-processed by a symbolic tree transformation routine that tries to eliminate systematic errors of the parser. The parser has been trained for three different languages and was successflflly integrated in tile Verbmobil speech-to-speech translation system. The parser achieves more than 90%/90% labeled precision/recall on pmsed Verbmobil utterances while 3% of German and 5% of all English input caunot be parsed.</Paragraph>
