Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a restricted version of Set-Local Multi-Component TAGs #28Weir, 1988#29 which retains the strong  generativecapacityofTree-LocalMulti-Component TAG #28i.e. produces the same derived structures#29 but has a greater derivational generative capacity #28i.e. can derive those structures in more ways#29. This formalism is then applied as a framework for integrating dependency and constituency based linguistic representations. null</Paragraph>
