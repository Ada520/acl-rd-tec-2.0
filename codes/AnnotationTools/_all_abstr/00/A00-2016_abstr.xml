Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper demonstrates that machine learning is a suitable approach for rapid parser development.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> From 1000 newly treebanked Korean sentences we generate a deterministic shift-reduce parser. The quality of the treebank, particularly crucial given its small size, is supported by a consistency checker.</Paragraph>
