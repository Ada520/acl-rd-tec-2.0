Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms have demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the UPenn TREEBANK as a gold standard. In this paper we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations.</Paragraph>
