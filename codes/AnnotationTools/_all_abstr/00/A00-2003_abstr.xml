Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Our aim in this paper is to identify genre-independent factors that influence the decision to pronominalize. Results based on the annotation of twelve texts from four genres show that only a few factors have a strong influence on pronominalization across genres, i.e. distance from last mention, agreement, and form of the antecedent. Finally, we describe a probabilistic model of pronominalization derived from our data.</Paragraph>
