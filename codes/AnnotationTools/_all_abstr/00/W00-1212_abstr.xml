Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Although substantial efforts have been made to parse Chinese, very few have been practically used due to incapability of handling unrestricted texts. This paper realizes a practical system for Chinese parsing by using a hybrid model of phrase structure partial parsing and dependency parsing. This system showed good performance and high robustness in parsing unrestricted texts and has been applied in a successful machine translation product.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Introduction Substantial efforts have been made to parse western languages such as English, and many powerful computational models have been proposed (Gazdar, et al, 1987, Tomita, M, 1986). However, very limited work has been done with Chinese. This is mainly due to the fact that the structure of the Chinese language is quite different from English. Therefore the computational model in processing English may not be directly applied to the Chinese language. Lin-Shan Lee et al (1991) proposed a Chinese natural language processing system with special consideration of some typical phenomena of Chinese. Jinye Zhou et al (1986) presented a deterministic Chinese parsing methodology using formal semantics to combine syntactic and semantic analysis. However, most of the proposed approaches were realized on small-scale lexicon and rule base (usually thousands words and tens or hundreds rules). It is still an open issue whether these models will work on real texts containing various ungrammatical phenomena. A parser capable of handling real text should have not only large lexicon and big rule base, but also high robustness in coping with different kinds of ungrammatical phenomena. Therefore, it is important to design a grammar scheme which not only is capable of representing the unique grammar structures which are different with English, but also qualified of handling unrestricted text.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Phrase structure scheme is usually used in English parsing models to represent sentence structures, but it is not convenient and not strong enough to express Chinese sentence by phrase structure in some occasions. For examples: Sentence-1 ~t~ff\]i~~.</Paragraph>
