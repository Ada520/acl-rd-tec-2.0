Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We report on a small study undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of combining portable information extraction with MT in order to support translingual information access. After describing the proposed system's usage scenario and system design, we describe our investigation of transferring information extraction techniques developed for English to Korean. We conclude with a brief discussion of related MT issues we plan to investigate in future work.</Paragraph>
