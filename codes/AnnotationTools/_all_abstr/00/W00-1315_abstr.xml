Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose an empirical method for estimating term weights directly from relevance judgements, avoiding various standard but potentially troublesome assumptions. It is common to assume, for example, that weights vary with term frequency (t f) and inverse document frequency (idf) in a particular way, e.g., tf. idf, but the fact that there are so many variants of this formula in the literature suggests that there remains considerable uncertainty about these assumptions. Our method is similar to the Berkeley regression method where labeled relevance judgements are fit as a linear combination of (transforms of) t f, idf, etc. Training methods not only improve performance, but also extend naturally to include additional factors such as burstiness and query expansion. The proposed histogram-based training method provides a simple way to model complicated interactions among factors such as t f, idf, burstiness and expansion frequency (a generalization of query expansion).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The correct handling of expanded term is realized based on statistical information. Expansion frequency dramatically improves performance from a level comparable to BKJJBIDS, Berkeley's entry in the Japanese NACSIS NTCIR-1 evaluation for short queries, to the level of JCB1, the top system in the evaluation. JCB1 uses sophisticated (and proprietary) natural language processing techniques developed by Just System, a leader in the Japanese word-processing industry. We are encouraged that the proposed method, which is simple to understand and replicate, can reach this level of performance.</Paragraph>
