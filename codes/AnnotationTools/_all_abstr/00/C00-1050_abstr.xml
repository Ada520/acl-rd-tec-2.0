Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose ~ kana-ka'~ji conversion systeln with input support based on prediction. This system is composed o\[' l,wo pm'ts: prediction of succeeding ka'1~:ji charac/;er st, rings from l,yped l,:ana ones, and ordinary k(vna-lca'l~(\]i conversion.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It automatically shows candidates of kanji character strings which the user intends to input.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Ore' prediction method features: (i)Arbitrary positions of typed t,:ana character slarings are regm'ded as l,he top of words. (ii)A system dictionary and a user dictionary are used, and eadl entry in the systcln dictionary has (:erl, ai.nly factor calculated fl'om the frequency of' words in corpora. (ill)Candidates are estimated by certainty factor and 'us@l, lness factor, and likely ones with greater \['actors than l;hresholds are shown. The proposed system could reduce the user's key inlmt operations to 78% from the original ones in ore' experinmnts.</Paragraph>
