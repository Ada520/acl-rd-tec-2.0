Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper treats the classification of the semantic functions performed by adnominal constituents in Japanese, where many parts of speech act as adnominal constituents. In order to establish a formal treatment of the semantic roles, the similarities and differences among adnominal constituents, i.e. adjectives and &amp;quot;noun + NO (in English &amp;quot;of + noun&amp;quot;)&amp;quot; structures, which have a broad range of semantic functions, are discussed. This paper also proposes an objective method of classifying these constructs using a large amount of linguistic data.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The feasibility of this was verified with a self-organizing semantic map based on a neural network model.</Paragraph>
