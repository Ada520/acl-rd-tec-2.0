<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents the use of prot)abilistie class-based lexica tbr dismnbiguati(m in targetwoxd selection. Our method emlfloys nfinimal 1)llt; precise contextual information for disambiguation. That is, only information provided by the target-verb, enriched by the condensed information of a probabilistic class-based lexicon, is used. Induction of classes and fine-tuning to verbal arguments is done in an unsupervised manner by EM-lmsed clustering techniques. The method shows pronlising results in an evaluation on real-world translations.</Paragraph>
