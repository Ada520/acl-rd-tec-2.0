1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper I describe the application of the WPDV algorithm to the CoNLL-2000 shared task, the identification of base chunks in English text (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). For this task, I use a three-stage architecture: I first run five different base chunkers, then combine them and finally try to correct some recurring errors. Except for one base chunker, which uses the memory-based machine learning systern TiMBL, 1 all modules are based on WPDV models (van Halteren, 2000a).</Paragraph>
