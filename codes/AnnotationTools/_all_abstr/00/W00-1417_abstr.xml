Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new approach to paratactic content aggregation in the context of generating hypertext summaries of OLAP and data mining discoveries. Two key properties make this approach innovative and interesting: (1) it encapsulates aggregation inside the sentence planning component, and (2) it relies on a domain independent algorithm working on a data structure that abstracts from lexical and syntactic knowledge.</Paragraph>
