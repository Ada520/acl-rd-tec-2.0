Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In Czech corpora compound verb groups are usually tagged in word-by-word manner. As a consequence, some of the morphological tags of particular components of the verb group lose their original meaning. We present a method for automatic recognition of compound verb groups in Czech. From an annotated corpus 126 definite clause grammar rules were constructed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> These rules describe all compound verb groups that are frequent in Czech. Using those rules we can find compound verb groups in unannotated texts with the accuracy 93%. Tagging compound verb groups in an annotated corpus exploiting the verb rules is described.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Keywords: compound verb groups, chunking, morphosyntactic tagging, inductive logic programming null</Paragraph>
