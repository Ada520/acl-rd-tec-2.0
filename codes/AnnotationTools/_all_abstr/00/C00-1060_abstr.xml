<Paragraph position="0"> This l)al)er (leseril)es a hybrid t)arsing method for Jal)anese which uses both a hand-crafted grammar and a statistical 1;e(:hniqlte. The key featm'e of our syst(nn is that in order to estimate likelihood for a parse tree, the systeln Ilses information taken from Mternative 1)artial parse trees generated by the grammar. This utilization of alternative trees enables us to construct a new statistical model called 'l}'it)let/Quadrul)let Model. We show that this model can capture a certain tendency in .\]apalmse syntactic structures and this point COlltril)lltes to ilnl)rovetllellt of l)al'sill~ acctlracy oil a shallow level. We rel)ort that, with an under-Sl)ecified HPSG-1)ased grammar and ~t maximum entropy estilnation, our parser achieved high a(:curacy: 88.6% accuracy in del)endency analysis of the EDR annotated eorlms, and that it, outI)erformed oth(u' lmrely statistical l)arsing methods on the same corpus. This result suggests that 1)rol)er t reatlnent of hand-crafted gra, mnml'S ca,n contribute to l)arsiltg accuracy on a shallow level.</Paragraph>
