Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> While language-independent selztence alignment programs typically achieve a recall in the 90 percent range, tile same cannot be said about word alignment systems, where normal recall figures tend to fall somewhere between 20 and 40 percent, in tile language-indepeudent case.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> As words (and phrases) for wlrious reasons are more interesting to align than sentences, we need methods to increase word alignment recall, preferably without sacrificing precision.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> This paper reports on a series of experiments with pivot aligtunent, which is tile use of one or more additional hmguages to improve bilingual word aligment. Tile conclusion is that in a multilingual parallel corpus, pivot alignment is a safe way to iucrcase word alignment recall without lowering the precision.</Paragraph>
