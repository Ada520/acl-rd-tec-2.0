</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present some novel nmchine learning techniques for the identilication of subcategorization infornmtion for verbs in Czech. We compare three different statistical techniques applied to this problem. We show how the learning algorithm can be used to discover previously unknown subcategorization frames from the Czech Prague 1)ependency Treebank. The algorithm can then be used to label dependents of a verb in the Czech treebank as either arguments or adjuncts. Using our techniques, we are able to achieve 88% precision on unseen parsed text.</Paragraph>
