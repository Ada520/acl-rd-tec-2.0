Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, a method for the word alignment of English-Chinese corpus based on chunks is proposed. The chunks of English sentences are identified firstly. Then the chunk boundaries of Chinese sentences are predicted by the translations of English chunks and heuristic information. The ambiguities of Chinese chunk boundaries are resolved by the coterminous words in English chunks. With the chunk aligned bilingual corpus, a translation relation probability is proposed to align words. Finally, we evaluate our system by real corpus and present the experiment results.</Paragraph>
