Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The purpose of this paper is twofold.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> First, we describe some complexity aspects of spoken dialogue. It is shown that, given the internal setting of our dialogue system, it is impossible to test even a small percentage of the theoretically possible utterances in a reasonable amount of time. An even smaller part of possible dialogues can thus be tested.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Second, an approach for early testing of the dialogue manager of a dialogue system, without the complete system being put together, is described. null</Paragraph>
