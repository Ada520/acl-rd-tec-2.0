Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Based on our experiences in VERBMOBIL, a large scale speech-to-speech translation system, we identify two types of problems that a generation component must address in a realistic implementation and present relevant examples. As an extension to the architecture of a translation system, we present a module for robustness preprocessing on the interface between translation and generation.</Paragraph>
