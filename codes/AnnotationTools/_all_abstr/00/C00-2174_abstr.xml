</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A Chinese generation module in a speech to speech dialogue translation system is presented he:re. The input of the generation module is the underspecified semantic representation. Its design is strongly influenced by the underspecification of the inlmtS and the necessity of real-time and robust processing. We design an efficient generation system comprising a task-oriented microplanner and a general surface realization module for Chinese. The microplanner performs the lexical and syntactic choice and makes inferences fiOln the input and domain knowledge.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The output of the microplanner is fully instantiated. This enables the surface realizer to traverse ltle input in a top-down, depth-first fashion, which in turn speeds the whole generation procedure. The surface realizer also combines the template method and deep generation technology in the same formalism.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Preliminary results are also presented in this paper.</Paragraph>
