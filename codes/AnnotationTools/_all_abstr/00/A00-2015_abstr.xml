Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper proposes a statistical method for learning dependency preference of Japanese subordinate clauses, in which scope embedding preference of subordinate clauses is exploited as a useful information source for disambiguating dependencies between subordinate clauses. Estimated dependencies of subordinate clauses successfully increase the precision of an existing statistical dependency analyzer.</Paragraph>
