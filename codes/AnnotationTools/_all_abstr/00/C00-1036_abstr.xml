This move is based on the view that the author's choices when authoring XML docutnciHs are best seen as language-i~eutral semantic decisions, that lhe SlftlClure can then be viewed as inlerlingual content, and that the textual oulpul should be derived from this co)lien\[ by language-sl~ecific realization mechanisms, lhus assimilating XML aufllol'ing lo Mullilingual Document Amhof ing.

We present two relalcd proposals for overcoming these limitalions: one (GI:) origitmting in the Iradilion of malhemalical proof edilors and conslructivc type lhcery, the other (IG), a specialixation of l)elinite Clause (_\]ranllllars strongly inspired by (iF.</Paragraph>
