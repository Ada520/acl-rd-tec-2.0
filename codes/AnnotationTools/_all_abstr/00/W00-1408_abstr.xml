Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> During argumentation, people persuade their audience using a variety of strategies, e.g., hypothetical reasoning, reasoning by cases and ordinary premise-to-goal arguments. In this paper, we offer an operational definition of the conditions for pursuing these strategies, and incorporate into a Bayesian argument-generation system a mechanism for proposing applicable argumentation strategies, generating specific arguments based on these strategies, and selecting a final argument.</Paragraph>
