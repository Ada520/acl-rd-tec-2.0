Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a new lexicalizcd grammar formalism called Lexicalized Tree Automata-based Grammar, which lcxicalizes tree acccptors instead of trees themselves. We discuss the properties of the grammar and present a chart parsing algorithm. Wc have implemented a translation module for conversational texts using this formalism, and applied it to an experimental automatic interpretation system (speech translation system).</Paragraph>
