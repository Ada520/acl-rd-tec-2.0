Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We discuss the advantages of lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar as an alternative to lexicalized PCFG for statisticalparsing,describingthe induction of a probabilistic LTAG model from the Penn Treebank and evaluating its parsing performance. We #0Cnd that this induction method is an improvementover the EM-based method of #28Hwa, 1998#29, and that the induced model yields results comparable to lexicalized PCFG.</Paragraph>
