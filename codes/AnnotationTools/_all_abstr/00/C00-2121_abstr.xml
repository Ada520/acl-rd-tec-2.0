Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we address the problem of discovering word semantic similarities via statistical processing of text corpora. We propose a knowledge-poor method that exploits the sentencial context of words for extracting similarity relations between them as well as semantic in nature word clusters.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The approach aims at full portability across domains and languages and therefore is based on minimal resources.</Paragraph>
