Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Dominance constraints are logical descriptions of trees that are widely used in computational linguistics.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Their general satis ability problem is known to be NP-complete. Here we identify the natural fragment of normal dominance constraints and show that its satis ability problem is in deterministic polynomial time.</Paragraph>
