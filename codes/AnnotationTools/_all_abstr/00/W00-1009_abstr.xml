</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We introduce CST (cross-document slructure theory), a paradigm for multi-document analysis. CST takes into aceount the rhetorical structure of clusters of related textual documents. We present a taxonomy of cross-document relationships. We argue that CST can be the basis for multi-document summarization guided by user preferences for summary length, information provenance, cross-source agreement, and chronological ordering of facts.</Paragraph>
