Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes an automatic method for extracting systematic polysemy from a hierarchically organized semantic lexicon (WordNet).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Systematic polysemy is a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable ways. Our method uses a modification of a tree generalization technique used in (Li and Abe, 1998), and generates a tree-cut, which is a list of clusters that partition a tree. We compare the systematic relations extracted by our automatic method to manually extracted WordNet cousins.</Paragraph>
