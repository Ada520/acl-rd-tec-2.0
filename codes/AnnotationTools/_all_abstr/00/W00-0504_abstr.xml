Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a system which supports English text queries searching for Mandarin Chinese spoken documents.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This is one of the first attempts to tightly couple speech recognition with machine translation technologies for cross-media and cross-language retrieval. The Mandarin Chinese news audio are indexed with word and subword units by speech recognition. Translation of these multiscale units can effect cross-language information retrieval. The integrated technologies will be evaluated based on the performance of translingnal speech retrieval.</Paragraph>
