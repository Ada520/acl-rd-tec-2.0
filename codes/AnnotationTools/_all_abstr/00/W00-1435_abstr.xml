Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We will demonstrate the ILEX system, a system which dynamically generates descriptions of data-base objects for the web, adapting the description to the discourse context and user type. Among other improvements in version 3, the system now generates from relational databases, and this demonstration will focus on this ability. We will also show how incremental extensions to the domain semantics improve the quality of the text produced.</Paragraph>
