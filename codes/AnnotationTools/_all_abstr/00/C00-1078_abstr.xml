<Paragraph position="0"> quire a procedure for choosing the set; of transfer rules for generating a target language translation from a given source language sentence. In an MT system with many comI)eting transfer rules, choosing t;he best, set of transfer rules for translation may involve the evaluation of an explosive number of competing wets. We propose a sohltion t;o this problem l)ased on current best-first chart parsing algorithms.</Paragraph>
