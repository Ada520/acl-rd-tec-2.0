Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Discourse markers foreshadow the message thrust of texts and saliently guide their rhetorical structure which are important for content filtering and text abstraction. This paper reports on efforts to automatically identify and classify discourse markers in Chinese texts using heuristic-based and corpus-based data-mining methods, as an integral part of automatic text summarization via rhetorical structure and Discourse Markers. Encouraging results are reported.</Paragraph>
