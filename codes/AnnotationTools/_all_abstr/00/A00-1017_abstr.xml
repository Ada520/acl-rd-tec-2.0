Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper introduces an approach to representing the kinds of information that components in a natural language generation (NLG) system will need to communicate to one another.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This information may be partial, may involve more than one level of analysis and may need to include information about the history of a derivation. We present a general representation scheme capable of handling these cases. In addition, we make a proposal for organising inter-module communication in an NLG system by having a central server for this information. We have validated the approach by a reanalysis of an existing NLG system and through a full implementation of a runnable specification.</Paragraph>
