Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Contextual information and the mapping from WordNet synsets to Cilin sense tags deal with word sense disambiguation. The average performance is 63.36% when small categories are used, and 1, 2 and 3 candidates are proposed for low, middle and high ambiguous words. The performance of tagging unknown words is 34.35%, which is much better than that of baseline mode.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The sense tagger achieves the performance of 76.04%, when unambiguous, ambiguous, and unknown words are tagged.</Paragraph>
