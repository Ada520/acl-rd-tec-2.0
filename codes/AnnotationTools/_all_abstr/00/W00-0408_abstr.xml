Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Summary evaluation measures produce a ranking of all possible extract summaries of a document., Recall-based evaluation measures, which depend on costly human-generated ground truth summaries, produce uncorrelated rankings when ground truth is varied. This paper proposes using sentence-rank-based and content-based measures for evaluating extract summaries, and compares these with recall-based evaluation measures. Content-based measures increase the correlation of rankings induced by synonymous ground truths, and exhibit other desirable properties.</Paragraph>
