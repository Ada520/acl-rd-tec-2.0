Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes MIMIC, an adaptive mixed initiative spoken dialogue system that provides movie showtime information. MIMIC improves upon previous dialogue systems in two respects. First, it employs initiative-oriented strategy adaptation to automatically adapt response generation strategies based on the cumulative effect of information dynamically extracted from user utterances during the dialogue. Second, MIMIC's dialogue management architecture decouples its initiative module from the goal and response strategy selection processes, providing a general framework for developing spoken dialogue systems with different adaptation behavior.</Paragraph>
