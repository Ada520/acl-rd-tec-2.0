Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a model where dialog obligations arise from the interplay of social goals and intentions of the participants: when an agent is addressed with a request, t:he agent's decision to commit to the requester's linguistic and domain goals is motivated by a trade-off between the preference for preventing a negative reaction of the requester and the cost of the actions needed to satisfy the goals.</Paragraph>
