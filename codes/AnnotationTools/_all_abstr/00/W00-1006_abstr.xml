Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Coherence relations have usually been taken to link clauses and larger units. After arguing that some phrases can be seen as discourse units, a computational account for such phrases is presented that integrates surface-based criteria with inferential ones. This approach can be generalized to treat intra-sentential cue-phrases. Since cue-phrases are not always present, referential relations between nominal expressions are additionally used to derive a text's discourse structure.</Paragraph>
