Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We have developed a rule-based system, Quarc, that can reada short story and find the sentence in the story that best answers a given question.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Quarc uses heuristic rules that look for lexical and semantic clues in the question and the story.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We have tested Quarc on reading comprehension tests typically given to children in grades 3-6. Overall, Quarc found the correct sentence 40% of the time, which is encouraging given the simplicity of its rules.</Paragraph>
