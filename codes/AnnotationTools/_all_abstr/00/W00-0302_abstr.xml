Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper accompanies a demo of the GoDiS system. Work on~hi~ system was reported at IJCAI-99 (Bohlin et-al.~ 1999). GoDiS is a prototype dialogue system for information-seeking dialogue, capable of accommodating questions and tasks to enable the user to present information in any desired order, without explicitly naming the dialogue task. GoDiS is implemented using the TRINDIKIT software package, which enables implementation of these behaviours in a compact and natural way.</Paragraph>
