Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Many corpus-based machine translation systems require parallel corpora. In this paper, we present a word-for-word glossing algorithm that requires only a source language corpus. To gloss a word, we first identify its similar words that occurred in the same context in a large corpus. We then determine the gloss by maximizing the similarity between the set of contextually similar words and the different translations of the word in a bilingual thesaurus.</Paragraph>
