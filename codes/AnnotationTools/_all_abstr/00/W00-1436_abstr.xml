<Paragraph position="0"> With the rising standard of the state of the art in text generation and the increase of the number of practical generation applications, it becomes more and more important to provide means for the maintenance of the generator, i.e. its extension, modification, and monitoring by grammarians who are not familiar with its internals.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> However, only a few sentence and text generators developed to date actually provide these means. One of these generators is KPML (Bateman, 1997). I~PML comes with a Development Environment and there is no doubt about the contribution of this environment to the popularity of the systemic approach in generation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> In the generation project at Stuttgart, the realization of a high quality development environment (henceforth, DE) has been a central topic from the beginning. The De provides support to the user with respect to writing, modifying, testing, and debugging of (i) grammar rules. (ii) lexical information, and (iii) linguistic structures at different levels of abstraction. Furthermore, it automatically generalizes tile organization of the lexica and the grammar. In what follows, we briefly describe oF,'s main features. The theoretical linguistic background of the DE is the Meaning-Text Theory (Mel'euk, 1988: Polgu~re, 1998). However. its introduction is beyond tile scope of this note: tile interested reader is asked to consuh the above reg erences as well as further literature on the use Of MTT ill text generation---for illSlallCe, (Iordanskaja ctal., 1992: I,avoie PS- Rainbow. 1997: (.'och. 1997).</Paragraph>
