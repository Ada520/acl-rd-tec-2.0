</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, lmrsing-as-deduction and constraint programming are brought together to outline a procedure for the speeitication of constraint-based chart parsers. Fob lowing the proposal in Shieber et al. (1995), we show how to directly realize tim inference rules tbr deductive parsers as Constraint Handling Rules (Fr{ihwirlh, 1998) by viewing lhe items of a chart parser its constraints and lhe constraint base as a charl. This allows the direct use of constraint resolution to parse sentences.</Paragraph>
