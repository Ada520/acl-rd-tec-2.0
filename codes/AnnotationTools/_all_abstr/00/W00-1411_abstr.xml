Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes an implemented system which uses centering theory for planning of coherent texts and choice of referring expressions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We argue that text and sentence planning need to be driven in part by the goal of maintaining referential continuity and thereby facilitating pronoun resolution: obtaining a favourable ordering of clauses, and of arguments within clauses, is likely to increase opportunities for non-ambiguous pronoun use. Centering theory provides the basis for such an integrated approach. Generating coherent texts according to centering theory is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem.</Paragraph>
