<Paragraph position="0"> This 1)aper focuses on the issue of named entity chunking in Japanese named entity recognition.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We apply the SUl)ervised decision list lean&gt; ing method to Japanese named entity recognition. We also investigate and in(:ori)orate several named-entity noun phrase chunking tech.niques and experimentally evaluate and con&gt; t)are their l)erfornlanee, ill addition, we t)rot)ose a method for incorporating richer (:ontextua\] ilflbrmation as well as I)atterns of constituent morphenms within a named entity, which h~ve not 1)een considered ill previous research, and show that the t)roi)osed method outt)erfi)rms these t)revious ai)proa('hes.</Paragraph>
