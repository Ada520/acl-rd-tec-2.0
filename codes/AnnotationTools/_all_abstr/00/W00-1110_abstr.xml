Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present our work on open-domain multi-document summarization in the framework of Web search. Our system, SNS (pronounced &amp;quot;essence&amp;quot;), retrieves documents related to an unrestricted user query and summarizes a subset of them as selected by the user. We present a task-based extrinsic evaluation of the quality of the produced multi-document summaries.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The evaluation results show that summarization quality is relatively high and does help improve the reading speed and judge the relevance of the retrieved URLs.</Paragraph>
