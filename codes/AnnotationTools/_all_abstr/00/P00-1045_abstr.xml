Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In terms of both speed and memory consumption, graph uni cation remains the most expensive component of uni cation-based grammar parsing. We present a technique to reduce the memory usage of uni cation algorithms considerably, without increasing execution times. Also, the proposed algorithm is thread-safe, providing an e cient algorithm for parallel processing as well.</Paragraph>
