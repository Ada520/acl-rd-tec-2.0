<Paragraph position="0"> Spoken dialogue managers have benefited from using stochastic planners such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, so far, MDPs do not handle well noisy and ambiguous speech utterances. We use a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)-style approach to generate dialogue strategies by inverting the notion of dialogue state; the state represents the user's intentions, rather than the system state. We demonstrate that under the same noisy conditions, a POMDP dialogue manager makes fewer mistakes than an MDP dialogue manager. Furthermore, as the quality of speech recognition degrades, the POMDP dialogue manager automatically adjusts the policy.</Paragraph>
