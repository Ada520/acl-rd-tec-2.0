</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a machine translation architecture that integrates the use el' examples for flexible, idiomatic translations with the use o1' linguistic rules for broad coverage and grammatical acctu'acy. We have implemented a prototype for English-to-Japanese translation, and our ewfluation shows lhat tile system has good translation quality, and only requires reasonable computational resources.</Paragraph>
