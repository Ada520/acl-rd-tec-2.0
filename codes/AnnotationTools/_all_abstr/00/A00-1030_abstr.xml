Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes an approach to providing lexical information for natural language processing in unrestricted domains. A system of approximately 1200 morphological rules is used to extend a core lexicon of 39,000 words to provide lexical coverage that exceeds that of a lexicon of 80,000 words or 150,000 word forms. The morphological system is described, and lexical coverage is evaluated for random words chosen from a previously unanalyzed corpus.</Paragraph>
