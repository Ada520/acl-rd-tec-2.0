Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes the results of some experiments using a new approach to information access that combines techniques from natural language processing and knowledge representation with a penalty-based technique for relevance estimation and passage retrieval. Unlike many attempts to combine natural language processing with information retrieval, these results show substantial benefit from using linguistic knowledge.</Paragraph>
