<Paragraph position="3">  (b) Na Shetlandsk~jch ostvovech se mluv( ANGLICKY.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4">  The conmmnicative function of the sentence can basically be rendered by understanding its topic (T) as 'what is the sentence about', and its focus (F) as the information that is asserted about the topic, i.e., schematically, the interpretation of the sentence S can be understood as</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> Thus, (1)(a) asserts, on its preferred reading (with just the locative modification constituting its focus) about where English is spoken that it is in the Shetlandt, which hardly can be accepted as true w.r.t, what we know of the actual world, if no specific context is present. (1)(b) is understood as true, stating about E. that it is spoken in the S.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="7"> In the TGTSs the order of nodes is such that all parts of T precede all parts of F. Moreover, the order of nodes corresponds to the scale of communicative dynamism (CD, see Section 3 below); a less dynamic node prototypically has the broader scope than a more dynamic one (if the nodes correspond to operators). F proper is then the most dynamic (the rightmost) node.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="8"> TFA is relevant also tbr the semantics of negation: null  (2) John (a) (b)  didn't come because he was ILL.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="9"> The reason for Jolm's not-coming was his illness.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="10"> The reason for John's coming (e.g. to the doctor) was not his illness but something else (e.g. he wanted to invite the doctor for a party).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="11"> With the paraphrase (a), the negated verb 'come' is included in T, i.e. the fact that John's being ill is the cause of an event is asserted about the event that he did not come. With (b), the main verb 'come' alto belongs to T, but what it negated, is the relation between T and F: John came, but what is asserted about his coming is that the cause of this event was not his illness (he might have been ill, though).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="12"> Every node in a TGTS is either contextually bound (CB) or non-bound (NB); this opposition is a linguistic couterpart of the cognitive dichotomy of 'given' vs. hmw', where also an item, if corresponding to a 'given' referent presented as occupying a newly characterized specific position (often in relation to one or more 'given' items), has the feature NB, cf.: (3) Give th, is to YOUR mother. (My parents don't like s~tch gifts.) kno',,,s oth ete,&amp;quot; ,lane.) Ho,.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="13"> ever, th.is time she only invited IIER.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="14"> The indexical pronoun 'your' in (3) and the anaphoric pronoun 'her' in (4) can only rethr to items that in a sense are 'known' in the given situation. However, in these examples, both of them occur as NB; their stress indicates their flmction as F proper of the respective sentence. Prototypically, an NB node belongs to F and a CB node is in T; however, a node not dependent immediately on a finite verb (esp. an adjunct) need not meet this condition. Thus, in (5), 'my' as a shifter, directly determined by the conditions of the discourse, is CB, although belonging to F, since it; depends on a part of F (see (HajiSovi~ et al., 1998) fbr a definition of T and F on the basis of contextual boundness and of syntactic dependency, as well as for other details of the given descriptive frmnework).</Paragraph>

2.2 The attribute TFA in PDT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Three values of the attribute TFA are distinguished with every node in a TGTS:  1. T a non-contrastive CB node, which always has a lower degree of CD than its governor, if any; 2. F an NB node (if different from the main verb, then following after its head word in the TGTS) 3. C a contrastive CB node Examples: (5) (VoIby v Izracli.) Po volbdeh.(T) si</Paragraph>

Thus, 'not to meet the condition of projectivity' concerns tim 'analytic' trees; this means, in other words, that this condition would not be met if the positions of x and y in the left-to-right order of the nodes in the TOTS (in the 'underlying word order') always corresponded to their positions in the surface (morphemic and %nalytic') word order.</Paragraph>

2.3 The position of a restored node
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The degree of CD of a node that is being restored (i.e. supposed to have been deleted in the surface form of the sentence), and thus also its position in the underlying word order, is determined on the basis of its relationship to its governing node. Since such a node ahnost always is contextually bound (with the exception of the specific case of coordinated structures, see the Note after point 8 in Section 2.2 above), it is placed to the left of its governing word; more specifically:  (a) if the restored node RN depends on a verb, then: (b) (c) (aa) if RN is not the single item depending  on the given verb token, then RN is to be added in the 'Wackernagel position'; null (ab) if RN has no sister nodes, then it is placed at the beginning of the clause; if RN is restored as depending on a noun (or adjective), I{N is placed as the least dynamic dependent of this governing word; if more than one node are inserted as depending on one and the same item, then their order should confornl to tile systemic (%anonical') ordering of the valency slots (see the remark on SO in Section 2.2 above, point 4).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Point (a) appears to be substantiated by the fact that e.g. the subject t)ronolln appears ill the zero form in Czech under similar conditions as the weak, clitic pronouns, for which the position imlnediately to the left of the verb is typical, cf. sentences such as VSera (on) p~'igel pozd5 \]Yesterday (he) canto here late\], Janu (oni) nevidSli \[lit.: .Jane-Accus they have-not-seen\], o1&amp;quot; (On) spal \[He was-sleeping\]. This concerns also such deletable items as e.g. the Directional with pfijet \[arrive\], cf. Jan dnes (sere/tam) ncp~'~;jcl \[lit. .John to-day (he,'e/there) has-not-arrived\]. The appropriateness of these preliminary rules is being checked during the tagging procedure, the results of which will be of importance for a more exact (and more complete) formulation of the relevant parts of the description of the sentence structure of Czech. This aspect  of the useflflness of the corpus tagging concerns also many ol;h(;r 1)oinl;s of grammar.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph position="0"> Within the tagging procedure, tim differences between the two levels of the left-to-right order can be described 1)y movelnent rules, a preliminary tbrm of which can be brietly characterized as follows: 1. if a node 1111 carries C and a node M2 del)ending on M1 is 1)laced to the right of a node M3 superordinate to M1 in the surtkce word order, then M1 is placed immediately to the left of M2 in the resulting tree; cf.</Paragraph>

3.2 Focus sensitive particles in the
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> hierarchy of comnmnicative dynamism The primary position of a focalizer ill a TR is at the boundary between tile topic and the focus of the verb clause and the tbcus of tile clause is then identical to tile focus of tile focalizer. If a fbcalizer is included in the topic, then its focus contains those items which in the TR are placed between this focalizer mid the next item ularked as C to tile right and are nlore dynamic than the tbcalizer).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It should be noted that CD is understood here as a partial ordering defined so that: (i) in every set of a head and its daughter nodes, every daughter node placed to the right of its head is more dynamic than evcry daughter node placed to the left of its head; (ii) the relation 'more dynanfic' is deternlined by the irrettexive trausil;ive closure of (i). ~i'hus, e.g. in the TI{ (10'), 'knows' is more dynalnic than 'Paul' and less dynmnic than 'saw' according to tile point (i), and both 'only' and 'Mary', being more dynanlic titan 'saw', are more dynmnie than ~knows' according to the point (ii); however, ~Thomas' is neither more nor less dynamic than 'knows'. If (10) is cutbedded into a more conlplex sentence as (a part of) its topic, titan 'Mary' is more dynanfic thml %nly' and has the f~atm'e C; thus, e.g. with 'Since Paul knows that Thomas saw only Mary, he is not afraid', 'Mary' constitutes the whole fl of 'only', similarly as in (10').</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Tile underlying word order W (a linear ordering) is then defined on the basis of CD, with (iii) and (iv) holding tbr every two nodes x and y in a tree: (iii) if node x is nlore dynamic than node y, then x tbllows y under W; (iv) if node x follows node y under W, node u is subordinated to x and node z is subordinate to y, then u tbllows both y and z, and x follows z under W.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> Among tile non-prototyt)ical , secondary positions of tbcalizers, there are also the cases of their clustering (e.g. 'not only'), as well as the sentences in which a focalizer itself constitutes the whole locus of tile sentence ('He DID realize this').</Paragraph>
