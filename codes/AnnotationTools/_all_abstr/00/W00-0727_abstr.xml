<Paragraph position="0"> We present the result of a symbolic machine learning system for the CoNLL-2000 shared task. This system, ALLiS, is based on theory refinement. In this paper we want to show that XML format not only offers a good framework to annotate texts, but also provides a good formalism and tools in order to learn (syntactic) structures.</Paragraph>
