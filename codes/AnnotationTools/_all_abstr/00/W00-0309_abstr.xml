</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Dialog man tigement addresses two specific problems: (1) providing a coherent overall structure to interaction that extends beyond the single turn, (2) correctly managing mixed-initiative interaction. We propose a dialog management architecture based on the following elements: handlers that manage interaction focussed on tightly coupled sets of information, a product that reflects mutually agreed-upon information and an agenda that orders the topics relevant to task completion.</Paragraph>
