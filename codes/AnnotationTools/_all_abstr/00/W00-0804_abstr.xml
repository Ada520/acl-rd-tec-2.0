Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes some preliminary results about Word Domain Disambiguation, a variant of Word Sense Disambignation where words in a text are tagged with a domain label in place of a sense label. The English WoRDNET and its aligned Italian version, MULTIWORD-NET, both augmented with domain labels, are used as the main information repositories. A baseline algorithm for Word Domain Disambiguation is presented and then compared with a mutual help disambignation strategy, which takes advantages of the shared senses of parallel bilingual texts.</Paragraph>
