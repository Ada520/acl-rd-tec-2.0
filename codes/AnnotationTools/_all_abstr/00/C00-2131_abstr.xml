Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe a system and methods for finding structural correspondences from the paired dependency structures of a source sentence and its translation in a target language. The system we have developed finds word correspondences first, then finds phrasal correspon(tences based on word correspondences. We have also developed a GUI system with which a user can check and correct tile correspondences retrieved by the system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> These structural correspondences will be used as raw translation I)atterns in a corpus-based translation system.</Paragraph>
