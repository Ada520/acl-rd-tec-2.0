</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper reported our work on annotating Chinese texts with information structures derived from HowNet. An information structure consists of two components: HowNet definitions and dependency relations. It is the unit of representation of the meaning of texts. This work is part of a multi-sentential approach to Chinese text understanding. An overview of HowNet and information structure are described in this paper.</Paragraph>
