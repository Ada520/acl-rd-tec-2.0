Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In natural language generation, different generation tasks often interact with each other in a complex way, which is hard to capture in the pipeline architecture described by Reiter (Reiter, 1994). This paper focuses on the interaction between a specific type of aggregation and text planning, in particular, maintaining local coherence, and tries to explore what preferences exist among the factors related to the two tasks.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The evaluation result shows that it is these preferences that decide the quality of the generated text and capturing them properly in a generation system could lead to coherent text.</Paragraph>
