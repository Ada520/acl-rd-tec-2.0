Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Knowledge of which words are able to fill p~rticular argum.ent slots of a predicate can be used tbr structural disambiguation. This paper describes a proposal :for acquiring such knowledge, and in line with much of the recent work in this area, a probabilistic approach is taken. We develop a novel way of using a semantic hierarchy to estimate the probabilities, and demonstrate the general approach using a prepositional phrase atta.chment experiment.</Paragraph>
