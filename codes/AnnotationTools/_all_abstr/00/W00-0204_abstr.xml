</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, we describe the Universal Networking Language, an interlingua to be plugged in a Web environment aiming at allowing for many-to-many information exchange, 'many' here referring to many natural languages. The interlingua is embedded in a Knowledge-Base MT system whose language-dependent modules comprise an encoder, a decoder, and linguistic resources that have been developed by native speakers of each language involved in the project. Issues concerning both the interlingua formalism and its foundational issues are discussed.</Paragraph>
