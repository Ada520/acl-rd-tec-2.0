Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In the context of language learning, we address a logical approach to information extraction. The system INTHELEX, used to carry out this task, requires a logic representation of sentences to run the learning algorithm. Hence, the need for parsers to produce structured representations from raw text. This led us to develop a prototypical Italian language parser, as a pre-processor in order to obtain the structured representation of sentences required for the symbolic learner to work. A preliminary experimentation proved that the logic approach to learning from language is able to capture the semantics underlying the kind of sentences that were processed, even if a comparison with classical methods as regards efficiency has still to be done.</Paragraph>
