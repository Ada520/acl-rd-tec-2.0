</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes a method to find phrase-level translation patterns from parallel corpora by applying dependency structure analysis. We use statistical dependency parsers to determine dependency relations between base phrases in a seN;ence. Our method is tested with a business expression corpus containing 10000 English Japanese sentence pairs and achieved approximately 90 % accuracy in extracting bilingual correspondences. The result shows that the use of dependency relation helps to acquire interesting translation patterns.</Paragraph>
