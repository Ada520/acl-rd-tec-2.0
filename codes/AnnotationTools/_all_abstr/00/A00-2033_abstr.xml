</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A long-standing issue regarding algorithms that manipulate context-free grammars (CFGs) in a &amp;quot;topdown&amp;quot; left-to-right fashion is that left recursion can lead to nontermination. An algorithm is known that transforms any CFG into an equivalent non-left-recursive CFG, but the resulting grammars are often too large for practical use. We present a new method for removing left recursion from CFGs that is both theoretically superior to the standard algorithm, and produces very compact non-left-recursive CFGs in practice.</Paragraph>
