Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This study measures comparative lexical and syntactic closure rates in annotated Chinese newspaper corpora from the Academica Sinica Balanced Corpus and the University of Pennsylvania's Chinese Treebank. It then draws inferences as to how large such corpora need be to be representative models of subject-matterconstrained language domains within the same genre. Future large corpora should be built incrementally only by combining smaller representative sublanguage collections.</Paragraph>
