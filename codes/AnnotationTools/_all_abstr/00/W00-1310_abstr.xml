</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a novel nonlocal lmlguage model which utilizes contextual information.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A reduced vector space model calculated from co-occurrences of word pairs provides word co-occurrence vectors. The sum of word co-occurrence vectors represents tile context of a document, and the cosine similarity between the context vector and the word co-occurrence vectors represents the \]ong-distmlce lexical dependencies. Experiments on the Mainichi Newspaper corpus show significant improvement in perplexity (5.070 overall and 27.2% on target vocabulary)</Paragraph>
