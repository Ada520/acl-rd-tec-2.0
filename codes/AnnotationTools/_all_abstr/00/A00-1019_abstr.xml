Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This work is in the context of TRANSTYPE, a system that observes its user as he or she types a translation and repeatedly suggests completions for the text already entered. The user may either accept, modify, or ignore these suggestions. We describe the design, implementation, and performance of a prototype which suggests completions of units of texts that are longer than one word.</Paragraph>
