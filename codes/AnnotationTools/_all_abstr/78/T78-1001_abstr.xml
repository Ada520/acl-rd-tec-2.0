ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A research program is described in which a particular representational format for meaning is tested as broadly as possible. In this format, developed by the LNR research group at The University of California at San Diego, verbs are represented as interconnected sets of subpredicates. These subpredicates may be thought of as the almost inevitable inferences that a listener makes when a verb is used in a sentence. They confer a meaning structure on the sentence in which the verb is used. To be psychologically valid, these representations should capture (at least): I. Similarity of meaning The more similar two verbs seem in meaning to people, the more their representations should overlap.</Paragraph>
