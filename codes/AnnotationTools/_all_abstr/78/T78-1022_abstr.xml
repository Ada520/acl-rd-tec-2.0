4. Conclusion
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The main argument of this paper combined perceptual and linguistic evidence to show that figural expressions in conceptual structure must include entities of a great number of ontological types. I take this to be a prototype for a novel sort of linguistic argumentation-one that treats descriptive semantics as fundamentally a psychological rather than logical discipline, and which seeks to account for the nature of thought and of human experience through grammatical structure. It is not clear that this is linguistics in the usual sense any more. Rather it is an attempt to use linguistic theory as a tool of cognitive psychology. This seems to me to be a promising way to go.</Paragraph>
