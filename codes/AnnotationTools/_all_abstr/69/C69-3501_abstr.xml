<Paragraph position="0"> The output of rule (iii) is a time (or time list) at which the relation indicated in the verb table holds.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The output may be ambiguous. For example, &amp;quot;Did Smith live in New York? &amp;quot; would result in both &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; as ambiguous output if &amp;quot;Smith&amp;quot; referred to one Smith who did and another who did not live in New York. &amp;quot;Who is Stan's sister? &amp;quot; would have ambiguous answers if Stan had more than one sister.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The output is a Vacuous Description if there is no valid semantic analysis of the query. For example in the sentence, &amp;quot;What is the income of the present king of France? &amp;quot; the phrase &amp;quot;present king of France&amp;quot; is a vacuous description in terms of our data if the data contains factual information on present-day France. This aspect of the analysis is not explicated here for lack of space.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> The second type of sentences, commands, are used for adding or deleting data. The rules and corresponding examples are:  (i) S -~ K V~ John is a boy~ Sally lived in Boston after 1950! (ii) S -~ K R of V~ The location of Sally was Boston after 1950'.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> The income of John is 10000~ The data is deleted if the verb table has the negative feature set. There are two restrictions on the above rules: the subject of the  verb table in (i) must not be modified; and the predicate of the verb table in (ii) must be a copula.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> The structure of the input sentence determines the structural relations to be established between items in the data. Subordinate clauses modify some item in another clause, or another clause as a whole. In REL English, clauses of the first type are always relative clauses; they are introduced by the pronouns &amp;quot;who&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;which&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;whom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;whose&amp;quot;. Clauses modifying other clauses are temporal clauses introduced by &amp;quot;before&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;when&amp;quot;, and result in time modification.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="7">  Verb tables representing relative clauses are completed using the noun which the clause modifies. Thus in (i) the N is used as the subject of the verb table, in (ii) either as subject or object. In (iii) the N for which the relation R holds is used as subject or object. Parallel to the above rules are rules with a comma preceding the relative pronoun. However, the rules with commas apply only  to post-modified NXs and the comma plays a disambiguating function. For instance, &amp;quot;parents of boys who left Boston&amp;quot; can be ambiguous; in our English, the relative clause refers to &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot;, while in &amp;quot;parents of boys, who left Boston&amp;quot; the relative clause refers to  in Boston? The output of rule (i) is a time modifier with the time interval t 1 = 0, t 2 = date specified by the subordinate clause. In the subsequent analysis these times are compared with the times on the main clause in the same way as time modifiers such as &amp;quot;before 1960.&amp;quot; For instance, let us assume that John married Jill in 1950 and that Jill left Boston in 1955. The output of rule (i) will now be the interval '0 to 1955 ~ and the times to be intersected are '0 to 1955' and 1950: o .... .......... ..... * The result is, obviously, a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answer. The output of rule (ii) is a tense modifier with the time interval t 1 - t 2 - date specified by the subordinate clause.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="8"> Quantifie r s By &amp;quot;quantifiers&amp;quot; we refer to &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;some&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;how many&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;what&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;each&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. Phrases containing such words are of</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="10"> particular importance since they often are used in referring to aggregates and more abstract concepts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="11"> Some examples are: Did some Smith who lived in New York move to Boston? How many Smiths have an income greater than 12000? What was the average between 1950 and 1960 of the incomes of each Smith? In such sentences, a class of objects is considered. The sentence constitutes a condition on each element of this class, the condition depending on the particular quantifier. Consider in detail the example: &amp;quot;Is Boston the location of all men? &amp;quot; To answer this question, each man must be considered in turn. We apply the term generation to this kind of a process. As each man is generated in turn, say man., the sentence &amp;quot;Is Boston the location of man.? &amp;quot; must be processed. If the answer to all cases is &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, then the original question is answered affirmatively; otherwise, it is answered negatively. In the case of the &amp;quot;some '~ generator, the answer would be affirmative if at least one of the men lives in Boston. For the question &amp;quot;What men live in Boston? ,i the answer is the list of men for whom the clause &amp;quot;man. lives in Boston&amp;quot; holds. 1 Several generators can be nested in a sentence. An example is: ~'Each Smith lived in what cities? &amp;quot; In general, the nesting of generators poses difficult and challenging problems. Although we  have been able to satisfactorily deal with these problems, an adequate treatment must be deferred to a separate publication because of their complexity.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="12"> Conjunctions Conjunction of R's was discussed above under relation modification. Conjunction of N's and V's set up generators according to the following rules :</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="14"> where the GE subscript indicates a generated phrase. If the J-phrase is &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;, the generator is an &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; generator; if the J-phrase is &amp;quot;or&amp;quot;, the generator is a &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; generator. An example is given in figure 8.</Paragraph>
