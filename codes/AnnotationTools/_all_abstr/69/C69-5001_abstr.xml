ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> MY paper will deal with the theoretical and practical questions of the co-textual analysis of texts.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The theoretical frame is contained by the chapters titled Introduction and Conclusion. MY aim here is to show that the automatization of the text analysis expects the accumulated experiences of the general linguistics and the documentation-theory to be summed up in one coherent theo~z. The linguistics has to examine the problems of documentational thesauri, abstracting, indexing from its own aspect, and has to insert these means and methods of the documentation in the system of the text-analysis.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The practical questions, certain concrete phases of the co-textual analysis of texts are dealt with in the chapters 2 and 3. In connection with certain steps we hope our demonstrative examples to contain solutions that will necesssril~ become simpler further on. Our aim was, first of all, the presentation of the complete process on a special type of text. Not all the parts of this complete process can be automatized yet. But the presentation will always happen with respect to the automatization.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> The next step should be the getting up of an analysing system that is built on the thesauristic elaboration of a relatively not big material. Then we have to solve such special problems of certain phases of the analysis that could not even mention in this flow chart-like survey.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Beside and after the theoretical analysis, only this can be the test of the usefulness of the system.</Paragraph>
