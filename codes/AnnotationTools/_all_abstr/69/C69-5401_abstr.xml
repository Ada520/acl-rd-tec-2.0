The detectiom of thim eurran@ is a proof of &amp;quot;grammaticality&amp;quot; for the word sequence under consideration. Electrical analogues can be designed also algebraically.

<Paragraph position="25"> 12. GRAPHS OF TRANSIA TIONS~ This chapter and the following are intended as su~ested applications of the above discussion, to the understanding of the process of translatlon. No attempt is ma@f to start from more rigorous definitions, 85 may be found for e~pie in /6\] or \[7\] * Here the process of translation of a simple sentence from language L I , into language ~, is regaz~led as consi% ring of the following operations s a) seek the given sentence in the d/ctionsry ~-~ | i b) if the whole sentence is found in the d/otionary, write e~ down the translation found there and ~ the process | c) if tBe sentence is not found in the dictionary, divide it into two subst~i~gs admitted by the gra-..sr (in fact, immediate constituents) ! d) seek each of the substr/ngs in ~he dictionary | - 11 e) if one substrlag is found in the dictionar~, write down its translation as given in the ~ctto.ar~ ! f) if one substring is not found in the dictionar~, divide it again into two further substr~ngs and then proceed again as indicated under d) ! 6) the prooess stop~ when a strin6 is obtained which contains only words belonging to the vocabulary of the language L2. A difficulty rises currently during the process of translation, and this is due to the fact that many words, or strings composed of more than one wo~d , admit two or mo~e translations.Such is the case with homonyms. Special subroutines have been developed to solve t~e problem of homonyms in digital translation of language. Suoh subroutines are based on successive step, of conditioned decisi~ To quote only a few very simple examples, MARCUS , in \[8J ,gives ske~ ohes of algorithms for translating into Roumanian &amp;quot;example&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;this &amp;quot;and for solving the homonymy of the French &amp;quot;pas&amp;quot; or ~he English &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;deg The problem is related to that of sequential unde1~standing of s sentence, as described by ZIEREH \[9\] * Let us put the DEoblem somewhat differently. To choose the writs word (or subst~i.~ between more than one possible variants, we need some supplementary condition, or conditions. A first and most important condition is that the right word (substT~g) must match grammatically the other words (subst~ings) in the string. That is to say that the right word (string) must form with another word ~subet~iag) in the string an ordered pair belonging to a certain rela. tion accepted by the grammar of the language ~. In the graphical representation suggested above, the right word (subst~,ng) must find itself on a continuous path with the other words (substr~gs) contained in the translation of the sentence under consideration, For example, let L I be the Englis~language and ~ the French. Let the sentence in L I be &amp;quot;we see the bo~'. It must be - 12 divided into (we see) (the boy). Putting side by side the correaponding parts of the English and French graphs, and marking by do~ ted lines the mapping defined in the dictionary, we can draw for the first substr/ng the graph  There are cases when the condition of gra~latioality is. not sufficient. Then a human translator,uses supplementary information, like general knowledge of the subject treated in the text, style used etc. Graphically, such information may be taken into account, for example, by assigning different colours to different types of subject Then the diagram must close through paths of different colour.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="26"> - 13 13. ELECTRICAL TRANSLATION. Let us assume now that we have at our disposal an electrical analogue N(L I) of the language ~, and an electrical analogue N(~) of the language L 2. We can further immaglne such an electrical connexion between the two analo~-ues that when a contact &amp;quot;ai&amp;quot; closes in N(LI) ~ all contacts corresponJding to the different possible translations of &amp;quot;ai&amp;quot; indicated by the dictionary ~-~2 are closed in N(L2). Then, when a continuous path of contacts is closed in N(L I) , its translation can be only a continuous path resulted in N(L2). For the selection pf ~he type of subject or of the style used, we can devise a switch that makes only the corresponding connections between N(L I) and N(~), or in N(~) and N(L 2) themselves. Such a mwitch may have, for ex~nple, positions marked * literature, mechanics, electricity, electronics, chemistry, medicine etc.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="27"> Some texts may contain sufficient information to enable the above switch to find automatically its right position. This idea ~serves an entirely separate discussion.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="28"> 14. CONCLUDING R~ARKS. What was suggested under 13 and 1@ are in fact examples of cabled logic. The implementation of these ideas for an entire language may encounter tremenduous technical difficulties. Designing graphs and electrical analogues for limited parts of language may prove however useful for demonstrational purposes. Thus it would be possible to achieve other models of language understanding and translation than those provided by digital programs and cunputers. The author feels that this is indeed interesting, far as explained by ZIERE~ \[9~ ~ the process of understanding must not be actually as divided into elementary steps as in an algox~thm -- &amp;quot;Dazu kommt noch dass beim Verstehen der gesprochenen Sprache dutch den Menschen auch der soziale Kontext und das Erlebnisverm~en des Menschen zum Abbau der angebotenen Information bei~gt. - 14 Hierin ist der, Computer dem Menschen unterle~en&amp;quot;.</Paragraph>
