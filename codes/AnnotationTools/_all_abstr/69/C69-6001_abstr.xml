<Paragraph position="0"> ~. The api~roach out1~ed below is to be understood as a component of a more general method of semantic interpretation of natural languages, Roughly spea~.ing th~s method (develor~.e6 in my forthcoming Elements of a Sem~.ntic Theor~r of }T~tur~J Lan6u~es) might be characterized, as fol\].ows: I deg. A semantic ~ystcm S in a very generP.\] form (like that of Carn~p's 'Language A' or 'L~n:~e~ b ,-o- ~' - c~._ Carn~p, Introduction to S~.bolic Logic and Its A~,\]ic,~t~ons, 1958) is constr~cted: this system contains : -A \]ex~con (si, eeifying t~e ~ig~z u~.ed)  - ~\]es of c~esi~nz, tion (el. C~-~ocp, ~ea~ing an~ Neces ~, ~96o, ~. 4) - Truth conc\]itions ~-T~ans f~rmation rules.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> 2 o . Rules of trans\].ation from a n~.tur~.l \].~.n~age, I~, into ' such c. seme.ntic system ~.re established.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> 3 deg . System S~is required to fulfil ~o~e cx-,-lic~t con~Stions  in order to make each \]'ernel sentence from ~, transl~.tab~_e in S. 4 deg . A new system, SL, is const~cted, ~-l~ch actu~,\]Jy fulfi\]_~ the impose d conditions on trans\]ability in S. St, in its gener~.l form, becomes an extension of S; when S~ ~s i'ut into corresyondence ~--ith a concrete \]o~n~-~age, the 'meanin,is' (i.e. des~n~t~) assigned by these rules to different descrSptive signs of S&amp; be.','hhichi c _ come more definite. Under such conditions, ever~j sign from S~ a translation of a sign from L. has the s~,e ~cnotstum as the corresponding sign from \]~-. &amp; - 2 .~deg. Under condition 3 deg, if ~ is a translation in S~ of a sentence ~ from ~, every characterization which holds for ~i bo\]c\]s for the corresponding P~. too.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> o l~et us assume that, in agreement with the translation rules L&amp;quot; each ~erneI sentence of the simplest form (that means sentences u'~th no adverbials determiners) (I) N Art V (2) N Art V N Art ..deg,..degdeg. o.o.dego...o ~., c~ be transJated in S by an individual description (of course, only uqlen the article has the function of individualization). In agreement with this assumption, if L~ would be English, a  ~entence like (3) the horse is runnin~ --:oul~ have as its appropriate translation in S~ the exT~rer~ien (4) (~y)~x)~HOx~ (x=y)).RU d (vhere~\]~O ~is a predicate consts~t which is a translation of c 1 ~'~'._~j. hors_~e, RU is a predicate constant which is a translation of ~. It is obvious that a translation like (4) does not account ~^~ of ~,r ~ .... tense the verb.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4">  ~n order to be able to represent in our semantic ~ystem the tez .~c ~tinction from natural languages, we take the fol\]ov-ing way: ~o. Ue shall transform our earlier system S: into a eoordi~te ~,au'~a_~ (in t1~e sense of Carnap's, Introduction .... , i~p. 161171; tee also Carnap, ~eanin~ and Necessity, 196o, pp. 7~,-75). The individual expressions in st.andard form are referr: o ir~ to '~fos~tions' in an ordered domain. An expression like 'a ~- ' J v'ou\]~ ~esignate the 'l~osition i' at the 'time j'. For our further discussion is enough to interpret each  location '~&amp;quot;4, ~&amp;quot; ..__a\[' as different &amp;quot;things' in the universe, and a ~...a ~' as different &amp;quot;locations&amp;quot; ezch expression of the form 'al, --&amp; &amp;quot;~ in time of the same &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;. The expression 'a ~' has to be inter~ --@ preted as designsJting a thing with no respect to its &amp;quot;time location&amp;quot;; in other words such an expression is to be understood as referring to a thir~ &amp;quot;abstracted&amp;quot; from time, or - what iz the snme for us - being in any time. The expression i refers to the &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; position or to the &amp;quot;nul\]-thing&amp;quot;. The number of the &amp;quot;posi- null tions&amp;quot; is, perhaps, unfinite.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> 2 deg .

<Paragraph position="10"> The exprem~ion~'a~ ' in (9)-(13) above refers !;o in ~.r~cJtr~.-~ ' 7f,&amp;quot;c .~oe: rich&amp;quot; oil&amp;quot; ~9\]~ ~ 'i}~J~' &amp;quot;. It is \]~u~own that, as far as~ the natural languages are conccrned, the category of tense could be roughly defined as the relation between the time of the action (,expressed by the verb) :~nd the time when the message is uttered; that* is to say the prerent &amp;quot;expresses&amp;quot; the simultaneity with the time the message is uttered, the ~osst expresses the anteriority with respect to the time of the message an8 the future expresses the ~osteriority :-Jth respect to the time of the message.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="11"> T~.J.s use of defining tenses suggests the fol\]owing treatment of tense estegory in terms of our semantic system: \].o. The time of the message is to be represented by any  v,~.._!ue of ~ from the expression 's~'.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="12"> 2 deg . If x is the 'thing' referred to by an individual desc~5pt~'on, then an expression like 'SIT~a~ .' expresses exactly the rel~=.t~on of the 'thing' referred to by t~e varmable x and the * time of the message&amp;quot; expressed by 'a~'. That is, 'SI~.Z~a. ~' means &amp;quot;~_'. i~ simultaneous ~:,ith the time of the rues:nags&amp;quot;, u%ich correspo t &amp;quot; nd.~ o tD~. _ definition of the ioresent. Analogously we. may inter7ret the expressions 'POSxadeg. ' , 'ANTxa B.' as corresponding to the  rcfJnitions ~Tiven to the future and the past, respectively.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="13"> -\scorching ~m with 1 deg an~ 2 deg , we may establish the fo\]lowing tr~'~nc~ ~tJ on ~le : &amp;quot; (14) Translation rule: Replace* the symbols Prez, ~ast, ~uture from the sequences Prez Verb, Past Ver___~b, Future Verb generated by~ a grcmmar G~ by the expressions: 'Sl~\[xa;', 'ANTxa;', 'POSxa~', respec~ ively.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="14"> - 5 Let us assui~e ~ow sentence (3) i~' .Tfiven together with its underlying P-marRer inthe three tense versions above discussed. We shall get the following three trans2ations:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="16"> - for thep~ast vers'ion, (4c) - for the future version.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="17"> Letus suppose that, in the'state of ~ffs, irs t referred to by our expressions, the only thing having the ~roperty 'horse' is the thing being in the point 'a6~;o let us consider further 'a~'Irepre senting the 'time of the message'. In this case, if we put 'a#' instead of ~, we may say that is true; moreover, (4a) is factua~l~ true.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="18"> If the position referred to by a ~ does not have actually thr --0 properties predicated by (4a5 or if there are seve___ral positions having the properties predicated by (as!). , then (4a) is .~s,~. e, snd moreover, factually false.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="19"> In contradistinction with the truth conditions of (4a), ~&amp;quot; &amp;quot; ~ 7~1e~2 are factua2, th~  that a23 these expressions 'are faIse onlyas con the ing 1-ostulates (9)-(13) and hence are 2ogica\]_ly  -6fn\] me. &amp;quot; &amp;quot;~ The intuitive interpretation of the L-falsehood of these exPres sions ~ns c~s follows: for instance (4a&amp;quot;) says that a past event ~n ni~=~O_taneous with the time of the message; ,sentence (4a&amp;quot;) says ~.ture that a - event, &amp;quot; tlt:,t is an event which is not yet oceuring in the time of the mes sa-ce is simultaneous with the time of the message. These interpret~.tions seem to me s.s giving a purely semantic expression of pragr_~tic~\] f~cts ~'~here the 'atitude' ~of the speaker towards the universe iz involved.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="20"> r. The above Troposed interpretation may account also for some &amp;quot;,~.bl~T~o_es of the natural langu~ges. We shall ta\]re an example fl-o~, other lan~uage t~an English, which makes a distinction ,bet&amp;quot;::een the 'pure present' and the &amp;quot;irogressive present&amp;quot;. For ~nstanee, in French the sentence:  (\]5) Le ehien cui dor~, mange beaucoup.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="21"> nig~ht be int~:rpreted as saying that: (15a) the dog ~ and eats at the time ~vhen the mes-, sage is uttered (15b) the dog sleeps at the time when the message is uttered and in c~eneral eats (much).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="22">  (We sb~ll disregard the word beaucou~, because it is ~rrelevant for our disc~ssicn.) Let 'CH'~, 'DO, ~r.d '1~t~' be the predicates by which chien, __ddegr-N:~ir nnd ~ ~rc to be translated in S~ ~nd 'a I' the time of the message. The tr~.~slation of (15~,l~o~ wfil\] be, resi.ectively: YAye Sl~C/\[xa~\] Let u~' consider S~, accounting for French, has a mea_~ing postulate saying predicates 'DO' n~ 'ITA' are incompatible simultaneous \]y.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="23"> Obviously, in t\]'.is c~se the c_lass comprising sentences (15~L', ~,I) it: inconsistent, or: the conjsnct~on of (15g') and (15~') is L-false.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="24"> If we choose the other ~o~ib\]e tr~.nslation, i.e.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="25"> (i5~) Then the class coml-.rising (15~#, ~&amp;quot;) can be ~o~sibly F-true and. so can be their corresponSing conjunction.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="26"> Translations (15~', ~'~ account for tl~e 'meaning' (15a); tr~tns-Sations (15~ ~, ~&amp;quot;) account for the r~eaning (15b). It is easy to see that the fccts nccounted for in ~ are of purely semantic nature, in contradistinction with the merely pragmatic nature of the facts accounted for in 4. In the former case only the 'meaning' of the expressions 'CHx', 'DOx', '~Ax' an~ 'SIK'xa~' is involved, whereas in the cases under 4 we h~ve had to do with various possibilities of &amp;quot;referrfing,, beJ~ at the ~isposal&amp;quot; of the speaker.</Paragraph>
