<Paragraph position="0"> Oppsala Chart Processor is a linguistic processor for phonological, morphological, and syntactic analysis.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It incorporates the basic mechanisms of the General Syntactic Processor. Linguistic rules as well as dictionary articles are presented to the processor in a procedural formalism, the UCP-formelism. The control of the processing rests upon the grammar and the dictionaries. Special attention has been devoted to problems concerning the interplay between different kinds of linguistic processes.</Paragraph>
