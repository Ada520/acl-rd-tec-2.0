BUNDLES AND SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS
Dorothee Reim~un

<Paragraph position="0"> Zentraltnstitut f~Lr Sprachwtssenschaft AdW DDR, Berlin Syntactic analysis - in our terms - means to construct a description of the syntactic structures of a given sentence, starting from a formal description of the syntactic features of .the wordfo~ (the -result of a preceding wordform ane.lysls).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The description of the syntactic structure as well as the formal description of the wordfo~ms have to follow a certain model, in our case the Dependency Gre~nme~ by ~NZE (1975)o A central point of the model - in respect 4o analysis - ere the so-called bundles. They represent the necessary syntactic knowledge of a language which is the base for analysi~ sentences of this le~guage. The bundles ere parts of trees in a very generalized form. If</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> is a bundle, then it means, that there are conditions for the nodes NO, N 1, N2, N 3, that there are relations between the * nodes expressed by the edses and their markings R 1 , ~, R 3 and that there is some order condition for the nodes, in the example 1; 1 N 2 N O N 3. Following the model, these bundles give us a high measure of surety, for the analysis.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> - 244 The bundles are stored in the system in a very concentrated form. For example for a noun group with a noun like &amp;quot;table&amp;quot; at the top there is only one budle with all possible facultative nodes. So we have in a bundle informations about the mode of occurrence of a node, i.e. if a node is obligatory, facultative etc.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> The bundles serve also as description for the dominance behaviour of wordforms (one part of the formal description of their features), thus we have a strong connection between a bundle and a wordformwhich can&amp;quot;stand&amp;quot; at the top of the bundle. For this purpose ~he bundles have a special external shape for linguistic work. For instance, a finite verb form of the German verb Sschreiben&amp;quot; has several bundles in its dominance component, one of these is  either in the form of a noun group in &amp;quot; the accusative case (PAT) or as a sub* ordinate clause with the conjunction &amp;quot;dase&amp;quot; (DAS) Free modifications llke local and temporal circumstances are possible as well.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> Of course, in the syntactic analysis system the bundles have another shape and~they contain more lnformatione There are two possibilities to use the bundles for syntactic analysis, the first one is to use them as proper rules, the eeco~ one is to use other methods, but to have the bundles as syntactic knowledge in the back@round. The first possibility is outlined in my dissertation (AROLD 1976) as a strong - 245 where null bottom-up and multiple-path analysPS8. But for a working system we intend to follow the second way.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="7"> In the paper a short summary of the system will be given. The syntactic analysts, of a sentence ~PSven by the formal description of the syntactic features of the wordforms iS made by three steps. These three steps differ one from the other by d~fferent methods.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="8"> In the first step an nau~nented transition network n (ATe) is used to construct a rough structure of the sentence. The second step uses the bundles which are members of t he dominance component of the wordforms to find out so-called subordlnntion possibllitiee. The result of the second step is a loop-free ~raph, which is transformed durPSng the third step to a ~aph contusing the dependency treem which desorPSbe the syntactic structures of the an~yeed sentence. In the third step the conditions of the bundles (obligator7 and facultative nodes etc.) are used as well as the condlttonm comPSn~ from the shape of the resulting graph.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="9"> Up to now we ~re only at the be~nn~ng of the ~nplementation of the system. 3ome remake about these problems am well as about the difficulties to include the analysis of coordtnated sentences w~ll be made in the paper too.</Paragraph>
