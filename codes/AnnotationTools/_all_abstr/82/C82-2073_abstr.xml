EXPLICIT SE~ENCES ARD SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> It is clear however that nelther (2) nor (3) can be considered as an &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; translation of (1). Sentence (2) does not carry the information that Leslie Is a woman and sentence (3) does not carry thls-information in the same way as (1)i the fact ~hat Leslie is a woman Is presupposed by (1) whereas it is asserted by (3). In other words sentence (3) is more explgclt than sentence (1). Following Keenan (1973) we will say that a sentence S is more explicit than a sentence TIff S and T have the same consequences but some, presupposition ofT Is an assertion of S.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Not only translations can be more explicit. Per instance (5) is more explicit that (4) since (4) presupposes (6) wherens (5) esserts (6):  (4) Blll knows that Sue has phoned (5) Sue has phoned and Bill knows whether Sue has phoned or not (6) Sue has phoned  RouKhly, defining sentences are, more explicit than &amp;quot;defined&amp;quot; sentenoese The questlon ld~ch we will try to answer in this paper is the follow~ one: are more explicit sentences - 299 this paper is the following one: are more explicit sentences syntactically more complex ones (notice that (3) is syntactically more eo~aplex than (I) as well as (53 is more complex than (4)).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> We will show that at least for some simple languages this ie indeed the case: more explicit sentences are syntactically more complex. We will consider essentially propositional categorial leaguage8, i.e. languages in which we have only the category of sentences end the category of sentential operators. Since we will distinguish two types of consequences,. presuppositon8 and assertions, our language must contain strongly intensional operators. A sentential operator 0 is 8aid to be strongly intensional iff for every possible world w and for every sentence P, if O(P) i8 true et X then there exist a sentence P&amp;quot; with the same truth value as P at w end such that O(P') is false at X (P end P&amp;quot; must be contigent sentences). Classic modal operators ere not strongly inten8i One 1 deg Now a presupposition can be defined e8 s consequence which has an argument under the scope of a strongly opaque operator in the presupposing sentence. More precisely a sentence S presuppose8 a sentence Tiff S semantically implies T and S i8 of the foist O(R) where 0 i8 8 strongly intensionel operator and R and T have e co-~on argument. It can be shown that Presupposition defined in this way i8 equivalent to the classical definition if one accepts a negation which preserves inteneionality (cf. Zuber 1980~. Now given * simple measure of syntactic complexity and the above definition of presupposition the following property for our propositional lsngunge holds: If S i8 more explicit than T, then S is syntactically more complex then T.</Paragraph>
