TEST-SCORE SEMANTICS
FOR NATURAL LANGUAGES
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> U.S.A.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Test-score semantics is based on the premise that almost everything that relates to natural languages is a matter of degree. Viewed from this perspective, any semantic entity in a natural language, e.g., a predicate, predicate-modifier, proposition, quantifier, command, question, etc. may be represented as a system of elastic constraints on a collection of objects or derived objects in a universe of discourse. In this sense, test-score semantics may be viewed as a generalization of truth-conditional, possible-world and model-theoretic semantics, but its expressive power is substantially greater.</Paragraph>
