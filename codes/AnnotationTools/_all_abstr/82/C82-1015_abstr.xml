<Paragraph position="1"> The DIALOGIC system translates English sentences into representations of their literal meaning in the context of an utterance. These representations, or &amp;quot;lngical forms,&amp;quot; are intended to be a purely formal language that is as close as possible to the structure of natural language, while providing the semantic compositionality necessary for meaning-dependent computational processing. The design of DIALOGIC (and of its constituent modules) was influenced by the goal of using it as the core language-processing component in a variety of systems, some of which are transportable to nee domains of application.</Paragraph>
