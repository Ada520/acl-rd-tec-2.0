AN ENGLISH-JAPANESE MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEM
BASED ON FORMAL SEMANTICS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Tbls paper proposes a new model of machine translation. In this model, the lambda formula obtained from the syntactic and Semantic analysis of a source language sentence is viewed as a target language generating function and the target language sentence is obtained as a result of evaluating the formula by functional application or ~-calculus. This model provides a systematic and powerful way of incorporating human knowledge on the languages. A prototype is constructed on the LISP system. The performance was tested for four sample texts taken from existing technical reports and computer manuals.</Paragraph>
