<Paragraph position="1"> This paper describes the characteristics of compact text as revealed in computer analysis of a set of physician notes. Computer processing of the documents was performed using the LSP system for natural language analysis. A numerical breakdown of syntactic and semantic patterns found in the texts is pre~ented. It is found that four major properties of compact text make it possible to process the content of the documents with syntactic procedures that operate on full free text.</Paragraph>
