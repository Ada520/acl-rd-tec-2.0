MY TERM
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> My term came at the time of the New York World Fair. The Association, still of MT as well as CL, was trying to crash the club that shared profits from the annual meetings of AFIFS. These were producing something over $20,000, a sum which in those days would do more than pay a fraction of one's annual overhead on an NSF grant. ACM of course was grabbing the bulk of this, but AEEE wasn't doing badly, to Judge by the magnificence of its Journal. I attended the powwows of the powers national and international. In spite of our run-down heels, they treated me courteously.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Among other actlvltfes we Journeyed out for a preview of the World Fair exhibits.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> IBM's massive show, with a que~tlon-answer demonstration as its highlight, didn't absorb all that much attention from a group, all of whom may have shaken the hand of Seymour Czay and pondered at his hilltop. Convention memories fade aftez so long a time. I remember best a conversation from a representative from Japan. He expressed great wonder at all things and beings American. The head of our computation center was a tall tennisbuff. When I gave my new friend the name his response was: &amp;quot;Oh the great ...?&amp;quot; I still haven't reconciled the possible interpretations on his use of the adjective.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> A couple of the more prominent members of the hardware crowd offered me a ride back to town after our group had paid its respects to a few more pavilions of the Fair. When we located their car it turned out to be an old four-door Buick, barely hanging together. The back seat was clogged with computer parts, an overflow from the trunk; I made a bit of zoom for myself among the pirated splendors and llstened to the hopeful chatter on the wonders of the new wo~id, hoping both the Buick and the absorbed drlvez would preserve me for it.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Thanks to a successful outcome of the zlde no doubt, I received issues of the elegant IEEE Journal for a few years. The Association did get a cut out of the AFIPS pot, as I recall, but since it was distributed i~ accordance with membership, our 600 didn't stack up too well against the 20,000 of ACM.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> The rest of my year was more routine.</Paragraph>
