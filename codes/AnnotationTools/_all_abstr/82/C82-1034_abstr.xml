MULTI-LEVEL TRANSLATION AIDS IN A
DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> At COLING80, we reported on an Interactive Translation System called ITS. We will discuss three problems in the design of the first version of ITS: (1) human factors, (2) the &amp;quot;all or nothing&amp;quot; syndrome, and (3) traditional centralized processing. We will also discuss a new version of ITS, which is now being programmed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This new version will hopefully overcome these problems by placing the translator in control, providing multiple levels of aid, and distributing the processlng.</Paragraph>
