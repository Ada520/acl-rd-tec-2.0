FACTOR-ANALYSIS OF COI~I~ESPONDENCES
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Given two finite sets I and J, we can say that there is a correspondence if the elements i I are associated with those of J by couple .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> There is a statistical correspondence if for each couple (i, j) there corresponds an integer &gt;t 0 : be (i, j) . For instance, we can define the statistical correspondence on the set I of nouns appearing in a certain text and the set J of verbs appearing in the same text . The number ~(i, j) will be equal to the number of times that the noun i is subject of the verb j.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> There is a random correspondence if there is defined on IxJ a probability measure described by the read positive function p such that Z p(i, j) - 1. Thus p(i, j) is the paired probability of the couple i, j (i, j) . Usually one studies a statistical correspondence by sampling a random correspondence . We therefore define p(i, j) by : .k(i, j) p(i, j) - where k = /--- k(i, j) ~ The purpose of this study is k to represent this correspondenci~ ~eometrically . We are going to associate to each element i of I a point in a Euclidian space of small dimension in a manner in which the distance between these points can be counted by the qualification of the elements associated with the elements j of J i. e. that most of the elements i and i' associated in the same manner as the elements of J more than their images in Euclidian space will be near each other . We will be able to proceed in the same fashion for J and we .will be able to then represent simultaneously in the Same Euclidian sp.ace the sets I and J in such a manner that the i and j with a high p(i, j) be near each other . To represent the set I and the correspondence on I x J defined by the p(i, j) we proceed in the KI following manner : first construct a &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; of poirts in the space To each element i of I take a corresponding point e. of R I ( all the coordinates of e. are zero except the first which has the value 1) provided</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> conditional probability .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> pO) To obtain the resulting cloud of points representing the set I in a space of weak dimension while conserving a little close the distance between the various points one will make a factori ~ analysis of the cloud i. e. we will determine mathematically the principal directions from which the cloud develops (the problem becomes the classical one of searching for the eigenvectors in the decreasing order of th~ eigenvalues of a matrix) : we will represent the cloud in this new system of axis thus determined .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> We can extend the method to a correspondence between a number of any sort of finite sets . We represent each set in a Euclidian space to be simultaneousl 7 all the sets in the same space . We are going to give below some examples of the application of this method. The calculations having being done on a computer .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="7"> First example : * ,, ill We are using the results of psychological experience explained below aJad ~armied out at the Faculty of Letters of Rennes . One presents to the subjects eight colors projected on a screen . The subjects must learn to associate with the colors eight buttons on a keyboard . We present successively these colors and after the subject has answered, he is told the correct answer . Wc thus obtains a statistical correspondence ; k(i, j) being the number of times that on the presentation of the color j Cordier Abstract iii the subject has answer~zl the button associated with color i . We are able to represent these inputs as a matrix .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="9"> We make a factor-analysis the same axis (one above, and the other below), the two sets object and response which coincide here with the set of eight colors : the order of the points is almost perfectly that of the wawe-lengths .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="10">  Correspondence between the names of the colors in three languages i, e. a correspondence .between three sets . ., I f we consider the spectrum of colors given by a prism, there is a gradation Of the colors from the extremities . Following the language the spectrum is divided into a certain numb'or of colors . For instance, in English it will be : red, orange, yellow, green, bluet purple , There is below a diagram representing the divisions of the spectrum Cordier Abstract iv in three languages I : in English, ina language of Rhodesia, &amp;quot;shona&amp;quot;, and in a language of Liberia, &amp;quot;Bassa&amp;quot; .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="11"> I n the second case the spectrum is divided in three parts, ( cipsWuka being found at the beginning and the end of the spectrum ). In the third case there are only two principal colors .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="12">  , , lowl orange red l .... ziz a To make a correspondence between the three set, we will give, coefficients to the common length of the spectrum for the three colors in three language s.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="13"> To make the factOr-analysis of this correspondence : we extract the two axis that which j;ives meon a plane diagram. We have represented simultaneously the three sets . We see that the colors divide themselves nearly on a circle according to the part of the spectrum which they cover (red being close to purple which is not true of wawe lengths but quite natural as far as perception is concernec</Paragraph>
