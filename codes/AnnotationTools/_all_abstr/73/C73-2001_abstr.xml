<Paragraph position="0"> cation of our theory in other than the vocabulary levels of the language system, since it excludes the situation when dissociation of a particular element yields a &amp;quot; chain reaction &amp;quot; which results in the whole rebuilding of the system.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> 7. The following problems would be solved within the framework of the present theory: a) if we have reason to suppose that a given set S of words appeared in a period preceeding some moment t (the value of parameter K is given), we can calculate the absolute value of t; examples of S: the set of words appeared before the splitting of the parent language; the set of words experienced the influence of a given phonetic law, etc.; this problem is the same as the one which glottochronology has attempted to solve.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> b) if we have reason to suppose that a given set S of words * appeared in a time period following some moment t, we can obtain the absolute value of t (in this case the words belonging to S are innovations, specifically, borrowings) or demonstrate that this moment does not exist (in this case, the given set S most probably consists of vernacular words).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> c) having historical data about the time of appearance of the words forming the initial part of the frequency dictionary (1000-3000 most frequent words) we can calculate, with the aid of (1), indexes of the evolution rate K (K= K(t)) for the whole vocabulary and for any stage of the language for which historical data is obtainable. d) analogously we can study with the aid of (2) the dynamics of language borrowing and obtain indexes of intensity of vocabulary interaction for any period for which corresponding data is available. 8. For testing the present theory we have taken the frequency lists for the following languages: Russian (two lists), Czech (one), French (two), l~oumanian (three), Spanish (one), German (two) and English (two). The volume of the lists is spread from 600 to 6000 words. The period for which lexicological data are available (depth of analysis did not exceed 1000-1500 years) was present as a system of intervals: (0, tl), (0, t~), (0, ts)..., where tl &lt; t~ &lt; t~ ... and zero corresponds to the present moment. We take t as an age of the word x if x was primarily registered in the language at t,, t, &gt; t and there exists no such time interval (0, t,) that t, &gt; t, &gt; t.</Paragraph>
