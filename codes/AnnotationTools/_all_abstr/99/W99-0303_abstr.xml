Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This is a proposal for a an XML mark-up of argumentation. The annotation can be used to help the reader (e.g. by means of selective highlighting or diagramming), and for further processing (summarization, critique, use in information retrieval).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The article proposes a set of markers derived from manual corpus annotation, exemplifies their use, describes a way to assign them using surface cues and limited syntax for scoping, and suggests further directions, including an acquisition tool, the application of machine learning, and a collaborative DTD definition task.</Paragraph>
