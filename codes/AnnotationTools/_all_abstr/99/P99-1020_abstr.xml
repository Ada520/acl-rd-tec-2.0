Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Selecting the most appropriate sense for an ambiguous word in a sentence is a central problem in Natural Language Processing. In this paper, we present a method that attempts to disambiguate all the nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives in a text, using the senses provided in WordNet. The senses are ranked using two sources of information: (1) the Internet for gathering statistics for word-word co-occurrences and (2)WordNet for measuring the semantic density for a pair of words. We report an average accuracy of 80% for the first ranked sense, and 91% for the first two ranked senses.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Extensions of this method for larger windows of more than two words are considered.</Paragraph>
