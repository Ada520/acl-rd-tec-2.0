Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> I show that the equational treatment of ellipsis proposed in (Dalrymple et al., 1991) can further be viewed as modeling the effect of parallelism on semantic interpretation. I illustrate this claim by showing that the account straightforwardly extends to a general treatment of sloppy identity on the one hand, and to deaccented foci on the other. I also briefly discuss the results obtained in a prototype implementation.</Paragraph>
