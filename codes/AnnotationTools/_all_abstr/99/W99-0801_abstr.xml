<Paragraph position="0"> Many disciplines currently have more or less organized activities concerned with developing resources to support Internetand computer-based instruction. This talk will examine this area, with particular focus on the questions:  aald what solutions might there be? We will see that in some cases computer-based intervention can lead to enhanced learning, and so provide a non-economic justification for the use of such techniques. AJso, current technological developments offer part of the answer to the problem that such resources are of_ teal not reused.</Paragraph>
