Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We propose a mixed language query disambiguation approach by using co-occurrence information from monolingual data only. A mixed language query consists of words in a primary language and a secondary language.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our method translates the query into mono-lingual queries in either language. Two novel features for disambiguation, namely contextual word voting and 1-best contextual word, are introduced and compared to a baseline feature, the nearest neighbor. Average query translation accuracy for the two features are 81.37% and 83.72%, compared to the baseline accuracy of 75.50%.</Paragraph>
