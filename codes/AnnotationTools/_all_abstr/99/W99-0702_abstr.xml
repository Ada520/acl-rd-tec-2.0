Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper presents an entropy-based approach to segment a corpus into words, when no additional information about the corpus or the language, and no other resources such as a lexicon or grammar are available. To segment the corpus, the algorithm searches for separators, without knowing a priory by which symbols they are constituted. Good results can be obtained with corpora containing &amp;quot;clearly perceptible&amp;quot; separators such as blank or new-line.</Paragraph>
