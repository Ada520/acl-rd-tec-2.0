Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We exploit and extend the Generative Lexicon Theory to develop a formal description of adnominal constituents in a lexicon which can deal with linguistic phenomena found in Japanese adnominal constituents. We classify the problematic behavior into &amp;quot;static disambiguation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dynamic disambiguation&amp;quot; tasks. Static disambiguation can be done using lexical information in a dictionary, whereas dynamic disambiguation requires inferences at the knowledge representation level.</Paragraph>
