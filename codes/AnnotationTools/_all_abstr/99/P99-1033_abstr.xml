Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a dependency parsing scheme using an extended finite state approach. The parser augments input representation with &amp;quot;channels&amp;quot; so that links representing syntactic dependency relations among words can be accommodated, and iterates on the input a number of times to arrive at a fixed point. Intermediate configurations violating various constraints of projective dependency representations such as no crossing links, no independent items except sentential head, etc, are filtered via finite state filters. We have applied the parser to dependency parsing of Turkish.</Paragraph>
