Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Dialogues may be seen as comprising commonplace routines on the one hand and specialized, task-specific interactions on the other. Object-orientation is an established means of separating the generic from the specialized. The system under discussion combines this object-oriented approach with a self-organizing, mixed-initiative dialogue strategy, raising the possibility of dialogue systems that can be assembled from ready-made components and tailored, specialized components.</Paragraph>
