Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A simple formalism is proposed to represent the contexts in which pronouns, definite/indefinite descriptions, and ordinal descriptions (e.g. 'the second book') can be used, and the way in which these expressions change the context. It is shown that referring expressions can be generated by a unification grammar provided that some phrase-structure rules are specially tailored to express entities in the current knowledge base.</Paragraph>
