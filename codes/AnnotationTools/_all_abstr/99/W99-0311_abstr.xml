Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper we present a rhetorically defined annotation scheme which is part of our corpus-based method for the summarisation of scientific articles. The annotation scheme consists of seven non-hierarchical labels which model prototypical academic argumentation and expected intentional 'moves'. In a large-scale experiments with three expert coders, we found the scheme stable and reproducible. We have built a resource consisting of 80 papers annotated by the scheme, and we show that this kind of resource can be used to train a system to automate the annotation work.</Paragraph>
