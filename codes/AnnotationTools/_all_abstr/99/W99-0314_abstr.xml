Automatically Extracting
Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper describes how to automatically extract grounding features and segment a dialogue into discourse units, once the dialogue has been annotated with the DR/ backward- and forward-looking tags. Such an approach eliminates the need for separate annotation of grounding, making dialogue annotation quicker and removing a possible source of error. A preliminary test of the mapping against a human annotator is presented.</Paragraph>
