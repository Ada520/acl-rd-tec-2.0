Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Nowadays there is a growing research activity centred in automated processing of texts on electronic form. One of the most common problems in this field is co-reference resolution, i.e. the way of knowing when, in one or more texts, different descriptions refer to the same entity.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> A full co-reference resolution is difficult to achieve and too computationally demanding; moreover, in many applications it is enough to group the majority of co-referential expressions (expressions with the same referent) by means of a partial analysis. Our research is focused in co-reference resolution restricted to proper names, and we part from the definition of a new relation called &amp;quot;replicancia&amp;quot;.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Though replicancia relation does not coincide extensionally nor intensionally with identity, attending to the tests we have carried out, the error produced when we take the replicantes as co-referents is admissible in those applications which need systems where a very high speed of processing takes priority.</Paragraph>
