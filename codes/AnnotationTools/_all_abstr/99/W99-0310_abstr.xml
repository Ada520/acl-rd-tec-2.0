Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper describes a new formal framework for comparison, design and standardization of annotation schemes for dialogue acts. The framework takes a recognition-based approach to dialogue tagging and defines four independent taxonomies of tags, one for each orthogonal dimension of linguistic and contextual analysis assumed to have a bearing on identification of illocutionary acts. The advantages and limitations of this proposal over other previous attempts are discussed and concretely exemplified.</Paragraph>
