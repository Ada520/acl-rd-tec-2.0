Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Identifying and classifying personal, geographic, institutional or other names in a text is an important task for numerous applications. This paper describes and evaluates a language-independent bootstrapping algorithm based on iterative learning and re-estimation of contextual and mOrphological patterns captured in hierarchically smoothed trie models. The algorithm learns from unannotated text and achieves competitive performance when trained on a very short labelled name list with no other required language-specific information, tokenizers or tools.</Paragraph>
