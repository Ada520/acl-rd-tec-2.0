<Paragraph position="0"> We envisage the standardlzauon of lexlcal resources as a three dlmenslonal process In developing, processing and using large multl-hngual and multi-purpose lexicons, a first set of dlfficult~es lies m the lack of a standard format that is flexible enough to cover many different languages and apphcaUons, but sufficiently ngld to enable the use ot a single lex~cal toolset shared across all these languages and apphcatlons A standard formahsm for encoding lex~cal knowledge enables the construction of a generic lexical toolset SGML has been used for example for pnnted dlct~onartes For computational dictionaries, a good alternative are feature structures (V6roms &amp; Ide 92, Ide &amp; V6roms 95) The second set of problems ts almost as acute as the first tt ~s very difficult to design a sound lex~cal architecture, hst the all the features that must be present for a variety of NLP apphcauons, predict the interaction between the various substructures, and predict the needs of the various NLP tools that would be accessing the dlcuonary A standard lextcal entry structure which defines the various features and provtde guldehnes to fill these features ~s a must for dictionary budders Thts level has been addressed for example m the Eagles program (Eagles 93) where it ts somettmes mtxed wtth the third dimension Finally, the problem of hngmstlc standards per se is addressed only partmlly by the definmons of gmdehnes and the use ot a standard lexlcal entry structme In a multdmgual setting, it is probably possible to dehne multdmgual types, such as a standard hst of part-of-speech However, this direction is stall very much a tesearc.h area related to the quest for a umversal grammar (see e g Cahdl &amp; Gazdar 95, 96) Current standard~zatlon ettolts such as Eagles define standards for content for particular languages only In Section 2, we present a generic lex~cal architecture that addresses point one the generic structure ot lex~eal ent~es and d~cuonar~es, notions of lex~cal schema and meta-schema, and the generic lex~cal toolset Secuon 3 presents the standard structure of lex~cal entries that ~s used m structuring a number of computational d~ct~onar~es at CRL The standard structure Is layered so that a particular dictionary could implement a sub-set of the layers only, whde still implementing the standard Furthermore, the structure ~s flexible enough so that a given layer can be extended {by adding new elements through an inheritance mechamsm) for a partlcular language, but forbids the redefinmon of the lexlcal meta-structure Section 4 mention open problems and on-going research on the topic of a umversal lex~s and a parameter-based approach to the acqmslt~on of a lex~cal profile</Paragraph>
