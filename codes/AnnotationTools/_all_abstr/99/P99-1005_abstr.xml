Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Distributional similarity is a useful notion in estimating the probabilities of rare joint events.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> It has been employed both to cluster events according to their distributions, and to directly compute averages of estimates for distributional neighbors of a target event. Here, we examine the tradeoffs between model size and prediction accuracy for cluster-based and nearest neighbors distributional models of unseen events.</Paragraph>
