Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In order to build robust automatic abstracting systems, there is a need for better training resources than are currently available. In this paper, we introduce an annotation scheme for scientific articles which can be used to build such a resource in a consistent way. The seven categories of the scheme are based on rhetorical moves of argumentation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our experimental results show that the scheme is stable, reproducible and intuitive to use.</Paragraph>
