Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a method for extracting parts of objects from wholes (e.g. &amp;quot;speedometer&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;). Given a very large corpus our method finds part words with 55% accuracy for the top 50 words as ranked by the system. The part list could be scanned by an end-user and added to an existing ontology (such as WordNet), or used as a part of a rough semantic lexicon.</Paragraph>
