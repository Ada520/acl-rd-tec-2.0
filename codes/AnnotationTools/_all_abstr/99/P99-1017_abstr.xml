</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Previous algorithms for the generation of referring expressions have been developed specifically for this purpose. Here we introduce an alternative approach based on a fully generic aggregation method also motivated for other generation tasks. We argue that the alternative contributes to a more integrated and uniform approach to content determination in the context of complete noun phrase generation.</Paragraph>
