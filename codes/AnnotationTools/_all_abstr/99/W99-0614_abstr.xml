Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper, a hybrid disambiguation method for the prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and interpretation problem is presented. 1 The data needed, semantic PP interpretation rules and an annotated corpus, is described first.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Then the three major steps of the disambiguation method are: explained. Cross-validated evaluation results', for German (88.6-94.4% correct for binary attachment ambiguities, 83.392.5% correct for interpretation ambiguities) show that disambiguation methods combining interpretation! rules and statistical methods might yield significantly better results than nonhybrid disambiguation methods.</Paragraph>
