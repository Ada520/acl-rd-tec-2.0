Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The paper describes FAME, a functional annotation meta-scheme for comparison and evaluation of existing syntactic annotation schemes, intended to be used as a flexible yardstick in multi-lingual and multi-modal parser evaluation campaigns. We show that FAME complies with a variety of non-trivial methodological requirements, and has the potential for being effectively used as an &amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot; between different syntactic representation formats.</Paragraph>
