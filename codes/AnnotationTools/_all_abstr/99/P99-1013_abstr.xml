Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In what sense is a grammar the union of its rules? This paper adapts the notion of composition, well developed in the context of programming languages, to the domain of linguistic formalisms. We study alternative definitions for the semantics of such formalisms, suggesting a denotational semantics that we show to be compositional and fully-abstract. This facilitates a clear, mathematically sound way for defining grammar modularity.</Paragraph>
