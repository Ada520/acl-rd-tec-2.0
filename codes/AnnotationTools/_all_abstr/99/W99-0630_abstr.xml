Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new method to automatically merge lexicons that employ different incompatible POS categories. Such incompatibilities have hindered efforts to combine lexicons to maximize coverage with reasonable human effort. Given an &amp;quot;original lexicon&amp;quot;, our method is able to merge lexemes from an &amp;quot;additional lexicon&amp;quot; into the original lexicon, converting lexemes from the additional lexicon with about 89% precision. This level of precision is achieved with the aid of a device we introduce called an anti-lexicon, which neatly summarizes all the essential information we need about the co-occurrence of tags and lemmas. Our model is intuitive, fast, easy to implement, and does not require heavy computational resources nor training corpus.</Paragraph>
