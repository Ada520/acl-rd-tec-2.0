Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The central questions are: How useful is information about part-of-speech frequency for text categorisation? Is it feasible to limit word features to content words for text classifications? This is examined for 5 domain and 4 genre classification tasks using LIMAS, the German equivalent of the Brown corpus. Because LIMAS is too heterogeneous, neither question can be answered reliably for any of the tasks. However, the results suggest that both questions have to be examined separately for each task at hand, because in some cases, the additional information can indeed improve performance.</Paragraph>
