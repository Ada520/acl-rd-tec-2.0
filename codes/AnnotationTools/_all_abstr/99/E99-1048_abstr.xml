Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This project measures and classifies language variation. In contrast to earlier dialectology, we seek a comprehensive characterization of (potentially gradual) differences between dialects, rather than a geographic delineation of (discrete) features of individual words or pronunciations. More general characterizations of dialect differences then become available.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We measure phonetic (un)relatedness between dialects using Levenshtein distance, and classify by clustering distances but also by analysis through multidimensional scaling.</Paragraph>
