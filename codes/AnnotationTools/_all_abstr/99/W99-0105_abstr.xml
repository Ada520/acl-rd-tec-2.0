</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper explores the idqa that the operations of positing and resolving bridging anaphora in NPs with deverbal heads can be successfully guided by considering as possible implicit relations those suggested by the argument structures of the corresponding verbs. We exploit the event/result reading distinction, combined with other aspeetual information. From there, we work out the idea that there is one particular argument, termed the faeourite, that plays a key role in correctly situating the NP referent within the discourse.</Paragraph>
