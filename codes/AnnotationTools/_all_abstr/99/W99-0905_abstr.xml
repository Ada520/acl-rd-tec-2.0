Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents an unsupervised method for choosing the correct translation of a word in context. It learns disambiguation information from non-parallel bilinguM corpora (preferably in the same domain) free from tagging.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our method combines two existing unsupervised disambiguation algorithms: a word sense disambiguation algorithm based on distributional clustering and a translation disambiguation algorithm using target language corpora.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> For the given word in context, the former algorithm identifies its meaning as one of a number of predefined usage classes derived by clustering a large amount of usages in the source language corpus. The latter algorithm is responsible for associating each usage class (i.e., cluster) with a target word that is most relevant to the usage.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> This paper also shows preliminary results of translation experiments.</Paragraph>
