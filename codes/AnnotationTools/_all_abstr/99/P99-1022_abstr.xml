Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a novel method of generating and applying hierarchical, dynamic topic-based language models. It proposes and evaluates new cluster generation, hierarchical smoothing and adaptive topic-probability estimation techniques. These combined models help capture long-distance lexical dependencies. degExperiments on the Broadcast News corpus show significant improvement in perplexity (10.5% overall and 33.5% on target vocabulary).</Paragraph>
