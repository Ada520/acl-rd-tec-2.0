Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a decision-tree approach to the problems of part-of-speech disambiguation and unknown word guessing as they appear in Modem Greek, a highly inflectional language. The learning procedure is tag-set independent and reflects the linguistic reasoning on the specific problems. The decision trees induced are combined with a high-coverage lexicon to form a tagger that achieves 93,5% overall disambiguation accuracy.</Paragraph>
