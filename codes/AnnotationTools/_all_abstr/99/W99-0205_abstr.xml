Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A noun phrase can indirectly refer to an entity that has already been mentioned. For example, &amp;quot;I went into an old house last night. The roof was leaking badly and ...&amp;quot; indicates that &amp;quot;the roof' is associated with &amp;quot;an old house&amp;quot;, which was mentioned in the previous sentence. This kind of reference (indirect anaphora) has not been studied well in natural language processing, but is important for coherence resolution, language understanding, and machine translation. In order to analyze indirect anaphora, we need a case frame dictionary for nouns that contains knowledge of the relationships between two nouns but no such dictionary presently exists.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Therefore, we are forced to use examples of &amp;quot;X no Y&amp;quot; (Y of X) and a verb case frame dictionary instead. We tried estimating indirect anaphora using this information and obtained a recall rate of 63% and a precision rate of 68% on test sentences. This indicates that the information of &amp;quot;X no Y&amp;quot; is useful to a certain extent when we cannot make use of a noun case frame dictionary. We estimated the results that would be given by a noun case frame dictionary, and obtained recall and precision rates of 71% and 82% respectively. Finally, we proposed a way to construct a noun case frame dictionary by using examples of &amp;quot;X no Y.&amp;quot;</Paragraph>
