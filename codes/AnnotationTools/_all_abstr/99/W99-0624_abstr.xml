Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A number of previous experiments on the role of lexical ambiguity, in Information Retrieval are reproduced on the'IR-Semcor test collection (derived from Semcor), where both queries and documents are hand-tagged ;with phrases, Part-Of-Speech and WordNet 1.5 senses.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Our results indicate that a) Word Sense Disambiguation can be more beneficial to Information Retrieval than the experiments of Sanderson (1994) with artificially ambiguous pseudo-words suggested, b) Part-Of-Speech tagging does not seem to help Improving retrieval, even if it is manually annotated, c) Using phrases as indexing terms is not a good strategy if no partial credit is given to the phrase components.</Paragraph>
