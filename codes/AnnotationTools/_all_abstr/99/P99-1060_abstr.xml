Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a new chart parsing method for Lambek grammars, inspired by a method for D-Tree grammar parsing. The formulae of a Lambek sequent are firstly converted into rules of an indexed grammar formalism, which are used in an Earley-style predictive chart algorithm.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The method is non-polynomial, but performs well for practical purposes -- much better than previous chart methods for Lambek grammars.</Paragraph>
