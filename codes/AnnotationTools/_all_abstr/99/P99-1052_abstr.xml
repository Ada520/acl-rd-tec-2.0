Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We describe a novel method for coping with ungrammatical input based on the use of chart-like data structures, which permit anytime processing. Priority is given to deep syntactic analysis. Should this fail, the best partial analyses are selected, according to a shortest-paths algorithm, and assembled in a robust processing phase. The method has been applied in a speech translation project with large HPSG grammars.</Paragraph>
