Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Context sensitive rewrite rules have been widely used in several areas of natural language processing, including syntax, morphology, phonology and speech processing. Kaplan and Kay, Karttunen, and Mohri &amp; Sproat have given various algorithms to compile such rewrite rules into finite-state transducers. The present paper extends this work by allowing a limited form of backreferencing in such rules. The explicit use of backreferencing leads to more elegant and general solutions.</Paragraph>
