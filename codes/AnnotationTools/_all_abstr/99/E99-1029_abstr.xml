</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> One of the claimed benefits of Tree Adjoining Grammars is that they have an extended domain of locality (EDOL). We consider how this can be exploited to limit the need for feature structure unification during parsing. We compare two wide-coverage lexicalized grammars of English, LEXSYS and XTAG, finding that the two grammars exploit EDOL in different ways.</Paragraph>
