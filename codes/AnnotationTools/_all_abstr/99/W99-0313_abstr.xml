Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents a novel two-level scheme for coding discourse structure in dialogue, which was created by the authors for the discourse structure subgroup of the 1998 DR/meeting on dialogue tagging. We discuss the theoretical motivations and framework for the coding proposal, and then review the results of coding exercises performed by the 1998 DR/ discourse structure subgroup using the new manual. Finally, we provide suggestions for improving the scheme arising from the working group activities at the third DRI meeting.</Paragraph>
