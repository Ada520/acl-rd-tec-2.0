1 Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Scrambling, both local and long-distance, has recently attracted considerable attention among linguists and computational linguists. In this paper, we will explore the adequacy of the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) formalism for dealing with long-distance scrambling I in German. We will show that TAGs cannot capture the full range of constructions derived by scrambling. I\[owever, Multi-Component TAGs (MC-TAG), an extension of TAGs introduced earlier \[Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988\] and utilized for linguistic purposes (e.g. for extraposition \[Kroch and Joshi 1986\]), can indeed capture the full range of constructions derived by scrambling. We will also present an ID/LP variant of TAG to capture the same constructions, and then comment on the relationship between the two systems. null</Paragraph>
