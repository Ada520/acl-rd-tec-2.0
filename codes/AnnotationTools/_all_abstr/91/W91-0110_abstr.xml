Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> We present a uniform computational architecture for developing reversible grammars for parsing and generation, and for bidirectipnal transfer in MT. We sketch the principles of a general reversible architecture and show how they are realized in the rewriting system for typed feature structu:res developed at the University of Stuttgart. The reversibility of parsing and gen:eration, and the bidirectionality of tralisfer rules fall out of general properties of the uniform architecture.</Paragraph>
