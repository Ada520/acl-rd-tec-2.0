ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The SIS community has made progress recently toward evaluating SLS systems that deal with dialogue, but there is still considerable work that needs to be done in this area. Our goal is to develop incremental ways to evaluate dialogue processing, not just going from Class D1 (dialogue pairs) to Class D2 (dialogue triples), but measuring aspects of dialogue processing other than length. We present two suggestions; one for extending the common evaluation procedures for dialogues, and one for modifying the scoring metric.</Paragraph>
