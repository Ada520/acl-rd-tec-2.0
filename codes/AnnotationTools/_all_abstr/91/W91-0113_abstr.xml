ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents Trace &amp; Unification Grammar (TUG), a declarative and reversible grammar formalism that brings together Unification Grammar (uG) and ideas of Government &amp; Binding Theory (GB) in an undogmatic way. A grammar compiler is presented that transforms a grammar written in the TUG formalism into two different forms, one being useful for parsing, the other being useful for generation.</Paragraph>
