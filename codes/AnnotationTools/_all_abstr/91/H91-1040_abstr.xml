ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The DARPA SLS Program is developing a technology that has been justified, at least in part, by its potential relevance to military applications. In an effort to demonstrate the relevance of SIS technology to real-world military applications, BBN has undertaken the task of providing a spoken language interface to DART, a system for military logistical transportation planning.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> We discuss the transportation planning process, describe the real-world DART system, identify parts of the system where spoken language can facilitate planning, and describe BBN's work towards porting the HARC SIS system to the DART domain.</Paragraph>
