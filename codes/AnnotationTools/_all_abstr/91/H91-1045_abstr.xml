ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A standard problem in parsing algorithms is Lhe organizaLion o~ branched searches to deal with an~iguous sentences. We discuss shift-reduce parsing oPS stochastic context-Gee granlnmrs and show how Lo construct a probabilistic score for tanking compeLing parse hypotheses.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The score we use is the likelihood Lhag the collection of subtrees can be completed into a l~ull parse tree by means of the steps the parser is constrained to \[oUow.</Paragraph>
