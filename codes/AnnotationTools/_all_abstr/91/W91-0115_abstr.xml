Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper propo~s a reversible architecture to handle not orily syntactic and semantic information but also pragmatic information.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> * I Existing architectures cannot represent pragmatic informatioil explicitly, and lack reasoning capability;given insufficient information. I argue that the techniques of plan representation and approximate reasoning are, in the enhanced argumentation system proposed here, effective for solving these problems. null</Paragraph>
