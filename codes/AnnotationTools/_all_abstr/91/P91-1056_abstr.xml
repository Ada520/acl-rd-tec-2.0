<Paragraph position="0"> This abstract outlines a parser implemented in a connectionist model of short term memory and reasoning 1 .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> This connectionist architecture, proposed by Shastri in \[Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1990\], preserves the symbolic interpretation of the information it stores and manipulates, but does its computations with nodes which have roughly the same computational properties as neurons. The parser recovers the phrase structure of a sentence incrementally from beginning to end and is intended to be a plausible model of human sentence processing. The formalism which defines the grammars for the parser is expressive enough to incorporate analyses from a wide variety of grammatical investigations 2. This combination gives a theory of human syntactic processing which spans from the level of linguistic theory to the level of neuron computations.</Paragraph>
