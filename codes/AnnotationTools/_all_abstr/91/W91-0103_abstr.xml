Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A class of constraint-based categorial grammars is proposed in which the construction of both logical forms and strings is specified completely lexically.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Such grammars allow the construction of a uniform algorithm for both parsing and generation.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Termination of the algorithm can be guaranteed if lexical entries adhere to a constraint, that can be seen as a computationally motivated version of GB's projection principle.</Paragraph>
