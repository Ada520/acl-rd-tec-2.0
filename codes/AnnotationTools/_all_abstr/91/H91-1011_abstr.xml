ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In 1989, our group first reported on the development of SUM-MIT, a segment-based speaker-independent continuous-speech recognition system \[13\] . The initial version of SUMMIT made use of fairly simple context-independent models for the lexical labels.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Recently, we have begun to incorporate more complex models of lexical labels that take into account a variety of contextual factors. These changes, along with an improved corrective training procedure for adapting pronunciation arc weights and a larger set of training data, have resulted in the reduction of error rate by almost a factor of two on the Resource Management task.</Paragraph>
