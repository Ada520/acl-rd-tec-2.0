INTRODUCTION
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The evaluation of data extraction systems can be supplemented by determinin g performance of the systems on a representative selection of linguistic phenomena .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The experiment performed as part of the MUC-3 evaluation was aimed at determinin g whether linguistic phenomena can be tested in isolation for state-of-the-art dat a extraction . Although not all of the methods of data extraction used by the participants in MUC-3 directly process linguistic phenomena, the methods are dealing with those phenomena in some manner because they are present in the input .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> Phenomena testing in MUC-3 is testing according to the characteristics of th e messages rather than characteristics of the systems processing those messages .</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> In order to determine the validity of phenomena testing at the current level of syste m performance, an experiment was run . The results of the experiment indicate that linguistic phenomena are isolatable and that performance for linguistic phenomen a can be measured using the MUC-3 scoring system .</Paragraph>
