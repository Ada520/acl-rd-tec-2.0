</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Using dictionaries as a model for lexicon development perpetuates the notion that the level of &amp;quot;the word&amp;quot;, as structurally defined, is the right starting place for semantic representation. Difficulties stemming from that assumption are sufficiently serious that they may require a re-evaluation of common notions about lexical representation. null</Paragraph>
