ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> In this paper* I will argue for a model of grammatical processing that is based on uniform processing and knowledge sources.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The main feature of this model is to view parsing and generation as two strongly interleaved tasks performed by a single parametrized deduction process. It will be shown that this view supports flexible and efficient natural language processing.</Paragraph>
