ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Languages differ in the concepts and real-world entities for which they have words and grammatical constructs. Therefore translation must sometimes be a matter of approximating the meaning of a source language text rather than finding an exact counterpart in the target language. We propose a translation framework based on Situation Theory.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The basic ingredients are an information lattice, a representation scheme for utterances embedded in contexts, and a mismatch resolution scheme defined in terms of information flow. We motivate our approach with examples of translation between English and Japanese.</Paragraph>
