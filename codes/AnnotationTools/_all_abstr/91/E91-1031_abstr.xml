Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Natural language systems based on Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) have mainly employed bottom-up parsing algorithms for processing. Conventional prediction techniques to improve the efficiency of the * parsing process, appear to fall short when parsing CUG.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> Nevertheless, prediction seems necessary when parsing grammars with highly ambiguous lexicons or with non-canonical categorial rules. In this paper we present a lexicalist prediction technique for CUG and show thai this may lead to considerable gains in efficiency for both bottom-up and top-down parsing.</Paragraph>
