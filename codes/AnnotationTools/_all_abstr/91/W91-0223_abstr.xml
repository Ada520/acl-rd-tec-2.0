Abstract
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> The question of what is &amp;quot;purely linguistic&amp;quot; is considered in relation to the problem of modularity. A model is proposed in which parsing has access to world knowledge, and both contribute to the construction of a discourse model. The lexical semantic theory of naive semantics, which identifies word meanings with naive theories, and its use in computational text interpretation, demonstrate that a shallow, constrained layer of knowledge which is linguistic can be identified.</Paragraph>
