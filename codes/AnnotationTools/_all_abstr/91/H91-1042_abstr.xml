ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> This paper presents the results of converting a standard Greham/Harrison/Ruzzo (GHR) parser for a unification grammar into an agenda-driven parsing system. The agenda is controlled by statistical measures of grammar-rule likelihood obtained from a training set.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The techniques in the agenda parser lead to substantial reductions in chart size and parse time, and can be applied to any chart-based parsing algorithm without hand-tuning.</Paragraph>
