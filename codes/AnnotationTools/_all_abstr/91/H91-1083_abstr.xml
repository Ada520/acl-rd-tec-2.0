<Paragraph position="0"> The goal of this project is to develop improved acoustic models for speaker-independent recognition of continuous speech, together with efficient search algorithms appropriate for use with these models. The current work on acoustic modelling is focussed on stochastic, segment-based models that capture the time correlation of a sequence of observations (feature vectors) that correspond to a phoneme. Since the use of segment models is computationally complex, we are investigating multi-level, iterative algorithms to achieve a more efficient search. Furthermore, these algorithms will provide a formalism for incorporating higher-order information. This research is jointly sponsored by DARPA and NSF.</Paragraph>
