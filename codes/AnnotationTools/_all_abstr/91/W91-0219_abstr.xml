1. Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> A dictionary in which dependencies among 400,000 word senses of the English and Japanese languages are described in detail (Concept Dictionary) is being developed by EDR. The goal of the development is to build a neutral dictionary for natural language semantic processing that is available for various application systems.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> The implementation of the dictionary is based on several linguistic semantic representation theories.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> For a long time, a series of trials for describing dependencies among words or word senses by bundling verbs, adjectives, etc., has been conducted. Establishing a deep case level and using a formalism independent of each language, Fillmore developed a theory of representation of dependency among words (Fillmore 1968).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> On the other hand, Fodor and Katz explained a mechanism of selecting interpretations of constituents in a sentence by using a formalism composed of a semantic marker, distinguisher and selection restriction (Katz and Fodor 1963). In contrast to these theories, Wilks proposed a point of view to consider word dependency not as a constraint but as a preference (Wilks 1975). In addition, Schank proposed to abstract connotations not only from senses of nouns but also those of verbs, and he named them &amp;quot;primitive actions&amp;quot; (Schank 1975).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> These semantic representation theories have been reviewed and used in developing practical natural language processing systems (Nagao 1985, etc.).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> As such development of practical natural language processing systems progressed, the importance of accumulating lexJcal descriptions became recognized by developers of such systems. That is, a dictionary large enough in terms of both the granularity of semantic markers and the number of words or word senses became necessary to build. Against the background of the situation, the development of the Concept Dictionary began (Kakizaki 1987, Yokoi et. el. 1989, Uchida, 1990, MiikC/ et. el. 1990a). The methodology of development of  the Concept Dictionary, which consists of a) concept descriptions, which represent dependencies among concepts and categories, and b) the concept taxonomy, which represent super-sub relations among concepts, is described in sections 2 and 3. Preference knowledge, which represents preference order of concept descriptions, is explained in section 4. in section 5, spheres of applications and limitations of the dictionary arc discussed.</Paragraph>
