1. Introduction
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> I believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can be informed by computational tools for lexicology as well as an appreciation of the computational complexity of large lexical databases. Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness of the grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems must account for these differences in their lexicons and grammars. The wedding of these disciplines is so important, in fact, that I believe it will soon be difficult to carry out serious computational research in the fields of linguistics and NLP without the help of electronic dictionaries and computational lexicographic resources (cf. Walker et al. \[forthcoming\] and Boguraev and Briscoe \[1988\]). Positioned at the center of this synthesis is the study of word meaning, lexical semantics, which is currently witnessing a revival.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="1"> In order to achieve a synthesis of lexical semantics and NLP, I believe that the lexical semantics community should address the following questions:  1. Has recent work in lexical semantics been methodologically sounder than the previous work in the field? 2. Do theories being developed today have broader coverage than the earlier descriptive work? Waltham, MA 02254 Q 1991 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 3. Do current theories provide any new insights into the representation of knowledge for the global structure of the lexicon? 4. Finally, has recent work provided the computational community with  useful resources for parsing, generation, and translation research? Before addressing these questions, I would like to establish two basic assumptions that will figure prominently in my suggestions for a lexical semantics framework. The first is that, without an appreciation of the syntactic structure of a language, the study of lexical semantics is bound to fail. There is no way in which meaning can be completely divorced from the structure that carries it. This is an important methodological point, since grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic theories.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="2"> The second point is that the meanings of words should somehow reflect the deeper, conceptual structures in the system and the domain it operates in. This is tantamount to stating that the semantics of natural language should be the image of nonlinguistic conceptual organizing principles (whatever their structure).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="3"> Computational lexical semantics should be guided by the following principles. First, a clear notion of semantic well-formedness will be necessary to characterize a theory of possible word meaning. This may entail abstracting the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences. For instance, this might suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled differently or separately from the semantic contributions of lexical items in composition. 1 Although this is not a necessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important for lexical semantic descriptions.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="4"> Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions (Gruber 1965; Fillmore 1968). As argued in Levin and Rappaport (1986), named roles are useful at best for establishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language. The distinctions possible with theta-roles are much too coarse-grained to provide a useful semantic interpretation of a sentence. What is needed, I will argue, is a principled method of lexical decomposition. This presupposes, if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theory of semantic composition, (2) the notion of semantic well-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to several levels of interpretation in the semantics (Scha 1983).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="5"> Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs. Recent work has done much to clarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic constructions that each allows (Levin 1985, 1989). Yet it is not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why the classes develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexicon and grammar. The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories (but see Miller and Johnson-Laird \[1976\], Miller and Fellbaum \[1991\], and Fass \[1988\]). That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication, and even less into the semantics of nominals. Not until all major categories have been studied can we hope to arrive at a balanced understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph position="6"> Stepping back from the lexicon for a moment, let me say briefly what I think the  James Pustejovsky The Generative Lexicon position of lexical research should be within the larger semantic picture. Ever since the earliest attempts at real text understanding, a major problem has been that of controlling the inferences associated with the interpretation process. In other words, how deep or shallow is the understanding of a text? What is the unit of well-formedness when doing natural language understanding; the sentence, utterance, paragraph, or discourse? There is no easy answer to this question because, except for the sentence, these terms are not even formalizable in a way that most researchers would agree on. It is my opinion that the representation of the context of an utterance should be viewed as involving many different generative factors that account for the way that language users create and manipulate the context under constraints, in order to be understood. Within such a theory, where many separate semantic levels (e.g. lexical semantics, compositional semantics, discourse structure, temporal structure) have independent interpretations, the global interpretation of a &amp;quot;discourse&amp;quot; is a highly flexible and malleable structure that has no single interpretation. The individual sources of semantic knowledge compute local inferences with a high degree of certainty (cf. Hobbs et al. 1988; Charniak and Goldman 1988). When integrated together, these inferences must be globally coherent, a state that is accomplished by processes of cooperation among separate semantic modules. The basic result of such a view is that semantic interpretation proceeds in a principled fashion, always aware of what the source of a particular inference is, and what the certainty of its value is. Such an approach allows the reasoning process to be both tractable and computationally efficient. The representation of lexical semantics, therefore, should be seen as just one of many levels in a richer characterization of contextual structure.</Paragraph>
