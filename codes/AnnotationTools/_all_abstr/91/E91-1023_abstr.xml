ABSTRACT
</SectionTitle>
<Paragraph position="0"> Prosodic Inheritance (PI) morphology provides uniform treatment of both concatenative and non-concatenative morphological and phonological generalisations using default inheritance. Models of an extensive range of German Umlaut and Arabic intercalation facts, implemented in DATR, show that the PI approach also covers 'hard cases' more homogeneously and more extensively than previous computational treatments.</Paragraph>
