<Paragraph position="0"> We consider lexicM operations and their representation in a unification based lexicon and the role of lexical semantic information. We describe a unified treatment of the linguistic aspects of sense extension and derivationM morphologicM processes which delimit the range of possible coercions between lexemes and give a preliminary account of how default interpretations may arise.</Paragraph>
