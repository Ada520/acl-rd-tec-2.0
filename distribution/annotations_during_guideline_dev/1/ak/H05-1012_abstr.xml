We demonstrate that it is feasible to create <term class="lr">training material</term> for problems in <term class="tech">machine translation</term> and that a mixture of supervised and <term class="tech">unsupervised methods</term> yields superior performance. The <term class="tech">probabilistic model</term> used in the alignment directly models the link decisions. Significant improvement over traditional <term class="tech">word alignment</term> techniques is shown as well as improvement on several <term class="tech">machine translation</term> tests. Performance of the algorithm is contrasted with <term class="tech">human annotation</term> performance.</S></Section></Paper>
