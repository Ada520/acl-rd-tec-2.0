We present empirical results casting doubt on this common, but unproved, assumption. Using a state-of-the-art Chinese <term class="tech">word sense disambiguation</term> model to choose <term class="other">translation candidates</term> for a typical IBM <term class="tech">statistical MT</term> system, we find that <term class="tech">word sense disambiguation</term> does not yield significantly better <term class="other">translation quality</term> than the <term class="tech">statistical machine translation</term> system alone. <term class="tech">Error analysis</term> suggests several key factors behind this surprising finding, including inherent limitations of current <term class="tech">statistical MT</term> architectures.</S></Section></Paper>
