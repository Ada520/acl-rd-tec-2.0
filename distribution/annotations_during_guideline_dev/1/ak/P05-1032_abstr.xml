We detail the <term class="other">computational complexity</term> and average <term class="other">retrieval times</term> for looking up <term class="lr">phrase translations</term> in our suffix array-based <term class="tech">data structure</term>. We show how <term class="tech">sampling</term> can be used to reduce the <term class="other">retrieval time</term> by <term class="other">orders of magnitude</term> with no loss in <term class="other">translation quality</term>.</S></Section></Paper>
