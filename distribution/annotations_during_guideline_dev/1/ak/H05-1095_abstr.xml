A method for producing such phrases from a <term class="lr">word-aligned corpora</term> is proposed. A <term class="tech">statistical translation model</term> is also presented that deals such phrases, as well as a <term class="other">training method</term> based on the <term class="other">maximization</term> of <term class="other">translation accuracy</term>, as measured with the <term class="tool">NIST</term> <term class="tech">evaluation metric</term>. <term class="other">Translations</term> are produced by means of a <term class="tech">beam-search</term> <term class="tech">decoder</term>. Experimental results are presented, that demonstrate how the proposed method allows to better generalize from the <term class="lr">training data</term>.</S></Section></Paper>
