These models can be viewed as pairs of <term class="tech">probabilistic context-free grammars</term> working in a 'synchronous' way. Two hardness results for the class <term class="other">NP</term> are reported, along with an <term class="other">exponential time</term> lower-bound for certain classes of algorithms that are currently used in the literature.</S></Section></Paper>
