A method for producing such <term class="other">phrases</term> from a <term class="lr">word-aligned corpora</term> is proposed. A <term class="other">statistical translation model</term> is also presented that deals such <term class="other">phrases</term>, as well as a <term class="tech">training method</term> based on the <term class="other">maximization of translation accuracy</term>, as measured with the <term class="other">NIST evaluation metric</term>. <term class="other">Translations</term> are produced by means of a <term class="tech">beam-search decoder</term>. Experimental results are presented, that demonstrate how the proposed <term class="tech">method</term> allows to better generalize from the <term class="lr">training data</term>.</S></Section></Paper>
