Basic methodology and practical techniques are reported in detail. The resultant <term class="lr">bilingual corpus</term>, 10.4M <term class="other">English words</term> and 18.3M <term class="other">Chinese characters</term>, is an authoritative and comprehensive <term class="lr">text collection</term> covering the specific and special <term class="other">domain</term> of HK laws. It is particularly valuable to <term class="other">empirical MT research</term>. This piece of work has also laid a foundation for exploring and harvesting <term class="lr">English-Chinese bitexts</term> in a larger volume from the <term class="other">Web</term>.</S>   </Section></Paper>
