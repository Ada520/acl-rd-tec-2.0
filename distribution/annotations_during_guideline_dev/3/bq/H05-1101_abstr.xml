These <term class="other">models</term> can be viewed as pairs of <term class="other">probabilistic context-free grammars</term> working in a 'synchronous' way. Two <term class="other">hardness results</term> for the <term class="other">class NP</term> are reported, along with an <term class="other">exponential time lower-bound</term> for certain classes of <term class="tech">algorithms</term> that are currently used in the literature.</S>   </Section></Paper>
