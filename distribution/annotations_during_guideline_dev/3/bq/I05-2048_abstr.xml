Over the last few years dramatic improvements have been made, and a number of <term class="other">comparative evaluations</term> have shown, that <term class="tech">SMT</term> gives competitive results to <term class="tech">rule-based translation systems</term>, requiring significantly less <term class="other">development time</term>. This is particularly important when building <term class="tech">translation systems</term> for new <term class="other">language pairs</term> or new <term class="other">domains</term>.</S>      <S position="1"> This workshop is intended to give an introduction to <term class="other">statistical machine translation</term> with a focus on practical considerations.</S>      <S position="2"> Participants should be able, after attending this workshop, to set out building an <term class="tech">SMT system</term> themselves and achieving good <term class="other">baseline results</term> in a short time.</S>      <S position="3"> The tutorial will cover the basics of <term class="other">SMT</term>:</S>      <S position="4"> Theory will be put into practice. <term class="tool">STTK</term>, a <term class="tech">statistical machine translation tool kit</term>, will be introduced and used to build a working <term class="tech">translation system</term>. <term class="tool">STTK</term> has been developed by the presenter and co-workers over a number of years and is currently used as the basis of <term class="tool">CMU's SMT system</term>. It has also successfully been coupled with <term class="tech">rule-based and example based machine translation modules</term> to build a <term class="tech">multi engine machine translation system</term>. The <term class="other">source code</term> of the <term class="tech">tool kit</term> will be made available.</S>   </Section></Paper>
