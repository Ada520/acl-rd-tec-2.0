During the years, <term class="other">linguistics</term> has been accompanied by various attributes.</S>      <S position="1"> For example <term class="lr">corpus</term> one. While a name <term class="lr">corpus</term> is relatively young in <term class="other">linguistics</term>, its content related to a <term class="other">language</term> - collection of <term class="other">texts</term> and <term class="other">speeches</term> - is nothing new at all. Speaking about <term class="other">corpus linguistics</term> nowadays, we keep in mind collecting of <term class="lr">language resources</term> in an <term class="other">electronic form</term>.</S>      <S position="2"> There is one more attribute that <term class="other">computers</term> together with <term class="other">mathematics</term> bring into <term class="other">linguistics</term> - computational. The progress from working with <term class="lr">corpus</term> towards the <term class="other">computational approach</term> is determined by the fact that <term class="other">electronic data</term> with the unlimited computer potential give opportunities to solve <term class="other">natural language processing issues</term> in a fast way (with regard to the possibilities of human being) on a statistically significant amount of <term class="other">data</term>.</S>      <S position="3"> Listing the attributes, we have to stop for a while by the notion of <term class="lr">annotated corpora</term>. Let us build a big <term class="lr">corpus</term> including all <term class="lr">Czech text data</term> available in an <term class="other">electronic form</term> and look at it as a sequence of characters with the <term class="other">space</term> having dominating status a separator of <term class="other">words</term>. It is very easy to compare two <term class="other">words</term> (as <term class="other">strings</term>), to calculate how many times these two <term class="other">words</term> appear next to each other in a <term class="lr">corpus</term>, how many times they appear separately and so on. Even more, it is possible to do it for every <term class="other">language</term> (more or less). This kind of calculations is <term class="other">language independent</term> it is not restricted by the <term class="other">knowledge of language</term>, its <term class="other">morphology</term>, its <term class="other">syntax</term>. However, if we want to solve more complex <term class="other">language tasks</term> such as <term class="other">machine translation</term> we cannot do it without deep <term class="other">knowledge of language</term>. Thus, we have to transform <term class="other">language knowledge</term> into an <term class="other">electronic form</term> as well, i.e. we have to formalize it and then assign it to <term class="other">words</term> (e.g., in case of <term class="other">morphology</term>), or to <term class="other">sentences</term> (e.g., in case of <term class="other">syntax</term>). A <term class="lr">corpus</term> with additional information is called an <term class="lr">annotated corpus</term>.</S>      <S position="4"> We are lucky. There is a real <term class="lr">annotated corpus</term> of <term class="lr-prod">Czech Prague Dependency Treebank</term> (<term class="lr-prod">PDT</term>). <term class="lr-prod">PDT</term> belongs to the top of the world <term class="other">corpus linguistics</term> and its second edition is ready to be officially published (for the first release see (Hajic et al., 2001)). <term class="lr-prod">PDT</term> was born in Prague and had arisen from the tradition of the successful <term class="other">Prague School of Linguistics</term>. The <term class="other">dependency approach</term> to a <term class="tech">syntactical analysis</term> with the main role of <term class="other">verb</term> has been applied. The <term class="other">annotations</term> go from the <term class="other">morphological level</term> to the <term class="other">tectogrammatical level</term> (level of underlying <term class="other">syntactic structure</term>) through the intermediate <term class="other">syntactical-analytical level</term>. The <term class="other">data</term> (2 mil. <term class="other">words</term>) have been annotated in the same direction, i.e., from a more simple level to a more complex one. This fact corresponds to the amount of <term class="other">data</term> annotated on a particular level. The largest number of <term class="other">words</term> have been annotated <term class="other">morphologically</term> (2 mil. words) and the lowest number of <term class="other">words</term> <term class="other">tectogramatically</term> (0.8 mil. words).</S>      <S position="5"> In other words, 0.8 million <term class="other">words</term> have been annotated on all three levels, 1.5 mil. <term class="other">words</term> on both <term class="other">morphological and syntactical level</term> and 2 mil. <term class="other">words</term> on the lowest <term class="other">morphological level</term>.</S>      <S position="7"> Besides the verification of <term class="other">'pre-PDT' theories</term> and formulation of new ones, <term class="lr-prod">PDT</term> serves as <term class="lr">training data</term> for <term class="tech">machine learning methods</term>. Here, we present a <term class="tech">system</term> <term class="tool">Styx</term> that is designed to be an exercise book of <term class="other">Czech morphology and syntax</term> with exercises directly selected from <term class="lr">PDT</term>.</S>      <S position="8"> The schoolchildren can use a <term class="tech">computer</term> to write, to draw, to play games, to page encyclopedia, to compose music - why they could not use it to <term class="tech">parse</term> a <term class="other">sentence</term>, to determine <term class="other">gender</term>, <term class="other">number</term>, <term class="other">case</term>, . . . ? While the <term class="tool">Styx</term> development, two main phases have been passed:</S>      <S position="8"> 1. transformation of an academic version of <term class="lr">PDT</term> into a school one. 20 thousand <term class="other">sentences</term> were automatically selected out of 80 thousand <term class="other">sentences</term> <term class="other">morphologically and syntactically annotated</term>. The complexity of selected <term class="other">sentences</term> exactly corresponds to the complexity of <term class="other">sentences</term> exercised in the current text-books of <term class="other">Czech</term>. A <term class="other">syntactically annotated sentence</term> in <term class="lr">PDT</term> is represented as a <term class="other">tree</term> with the same number of <term class="other">nodes</term> as is the number of the <term class="other">words</term> in the given <term class="other">sentence</term>. It differs from the schemes used at schools (Grepl and Karlik, 1998). On the other side, the <term class="other">linear structure</term> of <term class="lr">PDT</term> <term class="other">morphological annotations</term> was taken as it is only <term class="other">morphological categories</term> relevant to school syllabuses were preserved.</S>      <S position="9"> 2. proposal and implementation of exercises. The general <term class="other">computer facilities</term> of basic and secondary schools were taken into account while choosing a potential <term class="tech">programming language</term> to use. The <term class="tool">Styx</term> is implemented in <term class="tech">Java</term> that meets our main requirements <term class="other">platform-independent system</term> and <term class="other">system stability</term>.</S>      <S position="10"> At least to our knowledge, there is no such <term class="tech">system</term> for any <term class="lr">language corpus</term> that makes the schoolchildren familiar with an academic product. At the same time, our <term class="tech">system</term> represents a challenge and an opportunity for the <term class="other">academicians</term> to popularize a field devoted to the <term class="other">natural language processing</term> with promising future.</S>      <S position="11"> A number of <term class="other">electronic exercises</term> of <term class="other">Czech morphology and syntax</term> were created.</S><S position="12">However, they were built manually, i.e. authors selected <term class="other">sentences</term> either from their minds or randomly from <term class="other">books</term>, <term class="other">newspapers</term>. Then they analyzed them manually. In a given manner, there is no chance to build an <term class="tech">exercise system</term> that refects a real usage of <term class="other">language</term> in such amount the <term class="tech">Styx system</term> fully offers.</S>   </Section></Paper>
