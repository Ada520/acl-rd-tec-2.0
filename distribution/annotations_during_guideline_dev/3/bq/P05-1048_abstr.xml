We present empirical results casting doubt on this common, but unproved, assumption. Using a state-of-the-art <term class="other">Chinese word sense disambiguation model</term> to choose translation candidates for a typical <term class="tech">IBM statistical MT system</term>, we find that <term class="tech">word sense disambiguation</term> does not yield significantly better <term class="other">translation quality</term> than the <term class="tech">statistical machine translation system</term> alone. <term class="tech">Error analysis</term> suggests several key factors behind this surprising finding, including inherent limitations of current <term class="other">statistical MT architectures</term>.</S>   </Section></Paper>
