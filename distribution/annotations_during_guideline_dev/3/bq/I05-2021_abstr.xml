Much effort has been put in designing and evaluating dedicated <term class="other">word sense disambiguation (WSD) models</term>, in particular with the <term class="other">Senseval series of workshops</term>. At the same time, the recent improvements in the <term class="other">BLEU scores</term> of <term class="tech">statistical machine translation</term> (<term class="tech">SMT</term>) suggests that <term class="other">SMT models</term> are good at predicting the right <term class="other">translation</term> of the <term class="other">words</term> in <term class="other">source language sentences</term>. Surprisingly however, the <term class="other">WSD accuracy</term> of <term class="other">SMT models</term> has never been evaluated and compared with that of the dedicated <term class="other">WSD models</term>. We present controlled experiments showing the <term class="other">WSD accuracy</term> of current typical <term class="other">SMT models</term> to be significantly lower than that of all the dedicated <term class="other">WSD models</term> considered. This tends to support the view that despite recent speculative claims to the contrary, current <term class="other">SMT models</term> do have limitations in comparison with dedicated <term class="other">WSD models</term>, and that <term class="tech">SMT</term> should benefit from the better predictions made by the <term class="other">WSD models</term>.</S>   </Section></Paper>
