Basic methodology and practical techniques are reported in detail. The resultant <term class="lr">bilingual corpus</term>, 10.4M English words and 18.3M Chinese characters, is an authoritative and comprehensive text collection covering the specific and <term class="other">special domain</term> of HK laws. It is particularly valuable to <term class="other">empirical MT research</term>. This piece of work has also laid a foundation for exploring and harvesting English-Chinese <term class="lr">bitexts</term> in a larger volume from the Web.</S></Section></Paper>
