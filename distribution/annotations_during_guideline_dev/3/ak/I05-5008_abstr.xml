We measured the quality of the <term class="lr">paraphrases</term> produced in an experiment, i.e., (i) their <term class="other">grammaticality</term>: at least 99% correct sentences; (ii) their <term class="other">equivalence</term> in <term class="other">meaning</term>: at least 96% correct <term class="lr">paraphrases</term> either by <term class="other">meaning equivalence</term> or <term class="other">entailment</term>; and, (iii) the amount of internal <term class="other">lexical and syntactical variation</term> in a set of <term class="lr">paraphrases</term>: slightly superior to that of hand-produced sets. The <term class="lr">paraphrase sets</term> produced by this method thus seem adequate as <term class="lr">reference sets</term> to be used for <term class="tech">MT evaluation</term>.</S></Section></Paper>
