Using this approach, we extract <term class="lr">parallel data</term>from large <term class="other">Chinese</term>, <term class="other">Arabic</term>, and <term class="other">English</term> <term class="lr">non-parallel newspaper corpora</term>. We evaluate the qualityof the <term class="other">extracted data</term> by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art <term class="other">statisticalmachine translation system</term>. We also show that a good-quality <term class="other">MT system</term> can be built fromscratch by starting with a very small <term class="lr">parallel corpus</term> (100,000 words) and exploiting a large<term class="lr">non-parallel corpus</term>. Thus, our method can be applied with great benefit to <term class="other">language pairs</term> forwhich only scarce resources are available.</S></Section></Paper>
