Yet, they are scarcely used for the assessment of <term class="other">language pairs</term> like English-Chinese or English-Japanese, because of the <term class="tech">word segmentation problem</term>. This study establishes the equivalence between the standard use of <term class="tool">BLEU</term> in <term class="other">word n-grams</term> and its application at the character level. The use of <term class="tool">BLEU</term> at the character level eliminates the <term class="tech">word segmentation problem</term>: it makes it possible to directly compare commercial systems outputting unsegmented texts with, for instance, <term class="tech">statistical MT systems</term> which usually segment their outputs.</S></Section></Paper>
