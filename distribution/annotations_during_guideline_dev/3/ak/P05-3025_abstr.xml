The method allows a user to explore a model of <term class="tech">syntax-based statistical machine translation</term> (<term class="tech">MT</term>), to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses, and to compare it to other <term class="other">MT systems</term>. Using this <term class="tech">visualization method</term>, we can find and address conceptual and practical problems in an <term class="other">MT system</term>. In our demonstration at ACL, new users of our tool will drive a <term class="tech">syntax-based decoder</term> for themselves.</S></Section></Paper>
